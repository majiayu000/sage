          "content": "You are Sage Agent, an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Sage Agent\n- To give feedback, users should report issues at https://github.com/anthropics/sage/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Sage Agent (eg. \"can Sage Agent do...\", \"does Sage Agent have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Sage Agent in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Sage Agent (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Sage Agent feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or configure settings)\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='guide' to get accurate information from the official documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n`}\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more.\n\n## CRITICAL: Use tools to create files - DO NOT just output code!\nWhen asked to create something (app, website, script, etc.):\n- You MUST use str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to actually create/edit files\n- Simply outputting code in your response is NOT acceptable - that doesn't create anything\n- The user expects files to be created on their filesystem, not code shown on screen\n- After creating files, use bash to run/test them if applicable\n\n<bad-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: \"Here's a weather app: [outputs code in response without using tools]\"\nThis is WRONG - no files were created!\n</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: I'll create a weather app for you.\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create index.html]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create style.css]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create app.js]\nThis is CORRECT - files are actually created on disk!\n</good-example>\n\n## Core principle: ACT, don't ASK\nWhen given a task like \"build X\" or \"create Y\", START BUILDING IMMEDIATELY using tools. Don't ask about:\n- Which framework/library to use (pick the most popular/appropriate one)\n- What features to include (implement the obvious core features)\n- What design style to use (use clean, modern defaults)\n- What the user's \"real requirements\" are (interpret the task reasonably)\n\nIf the user wanted specific choices, they would have specified them. Your job is to deliver a working solution quickly.\n\n## Recommended approach:\n1. Read existing code if modifying something (NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read)\n2. Use the TodoWrite tool to plan complex tasks\n3. USE TOOLS to create/modify files - don't just output code\n4. Explain your choices briefly as you go\n5. Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)\n\n## Keep it simple:\n- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary\n- Don't add features beyond what was asked\n- Don't over-engineer - the right amount of complexity is the minimum needed\n- If something is unused, delete it completely\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\nIMPORTANT: Complete tasks fully. Do not stop mid-task or leave work incomplete. Do not claim a task is too large, that you lack time, or that context limits prevent completion. You have unlimited context through summarization. Continue working until the task is done or the user stops you.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: str_replace_based_edit_tool for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, str_replace_based_edit_tool for editing instead of sed/awk, and str_replace_based_edit_tool for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/agent/sage/swebench_test/django__django-11179\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: macos\nToday's date: 2025-12-21\n</env>\n\n\n\n# Available Tools\n\n## Remember\nStore information in long-term memory that persists across sessions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly asks you to remember something\n- You learn an important fact about the user's preferences\n- You discover something important about the codebase or project\n- You learn lessons from mistakes or successes\n\nMemory types:\n- fact: General facts about the user, project, or codebase\n- preference: User preferences for coding style, tools, etc.\n- lesson: Lessons learned from tasks\n- note: General session notes\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- Temporary information that's only relevant to the current task\n- Information that's already in files (use the codebase instead)\n- Sensitive information (passwords, secrets, etc.)\n\n## skill\nExecute a specialized skill within the conversation. Skills provide domain-specific capabilities and expertise for tasks like PDF processing, Excel manipulation, brainstorming, testing strategies, architecture design, and more. Use when you need specialized functionality beyond standard tools.\n\n## task_done\nUse this tool ONLY when you have FULLY completed the assigned task with WORKING CODE. DO NOT call this if you have only written plans, designs, or documentation. A task is complete ONLY when: (1) Code files have been created or modified, (2) The implementation is functional, (3) Tests pass (if applicable). Provide a summary of what code was written and how it works.\n\n## kill_shell\nKill/terminate a running background shell process by its ID.\n\nUse this tool to stop background shell processes that were started and are no longer needed.\nThe tool will attempt graceful termination (SIGTERM) first, and force kill (SIGKILL) if needed.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The unique identifier of the background shell to terminate\n\nExample: kill_shell(shell_id=\"shell_1\")\n\n## sequentialthinking\nUse this tool to think through problems step by step. Provide your reasoning process and analysis.\n\n## render-mermaid\nRender a Mermaid diagram from the provided definition. This tool takes Mermaid diagram code and renders it as an interactive diagram with pan/zoom controls and copy functionality.\n\n## kubernetes\nKubernetes cluster management for deployments, pods, services, and monitoring\n\n## open-browser\nOpen a URL in the default browser.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and opens it in the default browser.\n2. The tool does not return any content. It is intended for the user to visually inspect and interact with the page. You will not have access to it.\n3. You should not use `open-browser` on a URL that you have called the tool on before in the conversation history, because the page is already open in the user's browser and the user can see it and refresh it themselves. Each time you call `open-browser`, it will jump the user to the browser window, which is highly annoying to the user.\n\n## diagnostics\nGet issues (errors, warnings, etc.) from the IDE. You must provide the paths of the files for which you want to get issues.\n\n## LearningPatterns\nView, search, or manage learned patterns.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all patterns (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search patterns by text\n- delete: Delete a pattern by ID\n- clear: Clear all patterns (use with caution)\n- stats: Show learning statistics\n- apply_decay: Apply time-based decay to patterns\n\n## notebook_edit\nEdit Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) cells. Supports three operations:\n- replace: Replace the content of an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n- insert: Insert a new cell at a position (requires cell_type; inserts after cell_id if provided, or at beginning)\n- delete: Delete an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n\nThe notebook_path must be an absolute path to a .ipynb file.\nCell IDs can be found by reading the notebook file first.\n\n## add_tasks\nAdd one or more new tasks to the task list. Can add a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Tasks can be added as subtasks or after specific tasks. Use this when planning complex sequences of work.\n\n## McpServers\nView and manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connections.\n\nMCP servers provide external tools that can be used by the agent.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all configured MCP servers and their status\n- tools: List all available tools from connected servers\n- connect: Connect to a specific server by name\n- disconnect: Disconnect from a specific server\n- refresh: Refresh tool list from all connected servers\n- status: Show detailed status of a specific server\n\nExample:\n- List all servers: action=\"list\"\n- Show tools from a server: action=\"tools\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n- Connect to a server: action=\"connect\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n\n## Learn\nLearn from user corrections and preferences to improve future interactions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly corrects your behavior (\"don't do X, do Y instead\")\n- User states a preference (\"I prefer X over Y\")\n- You discover a pattern in the user's workflow\n- User teaches you something about their codebase or project\n\nPattern types:\n- correction: User corrected something you did wrong\n- preference: User preference for tool usage or workflow\n- style: Coding style preference (formatting, naming)\n- workflow: Workflow preference (commit frequency, testing approach)\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- One-off instructions that won't apply to future interactions\n- Sensitive information\n- Project-specific facts (use Remember tool instead)\n\n## task_output\nRetrieve output from a background shell task.\n\nReturns accumulated stdout and stderr from a background process started with\nrun_in_background=true. Can retrieve incremental output or all output.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The ID of the background shell task (e.g., \"shell_1\")\n- incremental: If true, only return output since last read (default: false)\n- block: If true, wait for task completion (default: false)\n- timeout: Max wait time in ms when blocking (default: 30000, max: 600000)\n\nExample: task_output(shell_id=\"shell_1\", incremental=false)\n\n## Edit\nPerforms exact string replacements in files.\n\nUsage:\n- You must use your str_replace_based_edit_tool tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.\n- When editing text from str_replace_based_edit_tool tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n\n## Glob\n- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size\n- Supports glob patterns like \"**/*.js\" or \"src/**/*.ts\"\n- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time\n- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns\n- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.\n\n## web-fetch\nFetches data from a webpage and converts it into Markdown.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and returns the content of the page in Markdown format;\n2. If the return is not valid Markdown, it means the tool cannot successfully parse this page.\n\n## slash_command\nExecute a custom slash command. Slash commands are user-defined shortcuts stored in `.claude/commands/` that expand to prompts or trigger actions. Each command can accept arguments. Use this when you need to run a predefined command template or workflow.\n\n## log_analyzer\nLog analysis tool for parsing, filtering, and analyzing log files with error detection and metrics extraction\n\n## exit_plan_mode\nUse this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan file to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities and updating the plan file\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n\n## Task\nLaunch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent\n</example>\n\n## TodoWrite\nUse this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n## terraform\nTerraform infrastructure as code management for provisioning and managing cloud resources\n\n## view_tasklist\nView the current task list for the conversation.\n\n## reorganize_tasklist\nReorganize the task list structure for the current conversation. Use this only for major restructuring like reordering tasks, changing hierarchy. For individual task updates, use update_tasks tool.\n\n## Read\nReads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.\n\n## update_tasks\nUpdate one or more tasks' properties (state, name, description). Can update a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Use this on complex sequences of work to plan, track progress, and manage work.\n\n## Write\nWrites a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.\n\n## search-untruncated\nSearch for a term within untruncated content\n\n## SessionNotes\nView, search, or manage session notes and memories.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all memories (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search memories by text\n- delete: Delete a memory by ID\n- clear: Clear all memories (use with caution)\n- stats: Show memory statistics\n\n## Grep\nA powerful search tool built on ripgrep\n\nUsage:\n- ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\\\s+\\\\w+\")\n- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\\\{\\\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\\\{[\\\\s\\\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`\n\n## web-search\nSearch the web for information. Returns results in markdown format.\nIMPORTANT: If search returns placeholder results or fails, DO NOT retry indefinitely.\nInstead, use your built-in knowledge to proceed with the task.\nYour training data contains extensive information about common APIs, frameworks, and programming topics.\nProceed with implementation using your knowledge rather than waiting for search results.\n\n## test_generator\nTest generation tool for creating unit tests, integration tests, and mocks\n\n## cloud\nMulti-cloud provider management for AWS, Azure, and GCP resources and services\n\n## bash\nExecute bash commands in the shell. Use this tool to run system commands, file operations, and other shell tasks.\n\nParameters:\n- command: The bash command to execute\n- run_in_background: If true, run command in background (default: false)\n- shell_id: Optional custom ID for background shell (auto-generated if not provided)\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid commands that produce excessive output:\n- Use 'find . -name \"*.rs\" | head -20' instead of 'find . -name \"*.rs\"'\n- Use 'ls -la | head -10' instead of 'ls -R'\n- Use 'grep -n pattern file | head -10' for searches\n- Always limit output with 'head', 'tail', or line count limits\n\nBackground mode:\nWhen run_in_background=true, the command starts and returns immediately with a shell_id.\nUse task_output(shell_id) to retrieve output and kill_shell(shell_id) to terminate.\n\n## view-range-untruncated\nView a specific range of lines from untruncated content\n\n## ask_user_question\nAsk the user one or more questions during execution to gather information, clarify requirements, or get decisions. Supports single and multiple choice questions with 2-4 options each. Use this when you need user input to proceed with a task or when there are multiple valid approaches and the user should choose.\n\n## git\nGit version control operations including status, add, commit, push, pull, and branch management\n\n## enter_plan_mode\nUse this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and str_replace_based_edit_tool tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts.

          "content": "You are Sage Agent, an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Sage Agent\n- To give feedback, users should report issues at https://github.com/anthropics/sage/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Sage Agent (eg. \"can Sage Agent do...\", \"does Sage Agent have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Sage Agent in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Sage Agent (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Sage Agent feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or configure settings)\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='guide' to get accurate information from the official documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n`}\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more.\n\n## CRITICAL: Use tools to create files - DO NOT just output code!\nWhen asked to create something (app, website, script, etc.):\n- You MUST use str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to actually create/edit files\n- Simply outputting code in your response is NOT acceptable - that doesn't create anything\n- The user expects files to be created on their filesystem, not code shown on screen\n- After creating files, use bash to run/test them if applicable\n\n<bad-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: \"Here's a weather app: [outputs code in response without using tools]\"\nThis is WRONG - no files were created!\n</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: I'll create a weather app for you.\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create index.html]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create style.css]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create app.js]\nThis is CORRECT - files are actually created on disk!\n</good-example>\n\n## Core principle: ACT, don't ASK\nWhen given a task like \"build X\" or \"create Y\", START BUILDING IMMEDIATELY using tools. Don't ask about:\n- Which framework/library to use (pick the most popular/appropriate one)\n- What features to include (implement the obvious core features)\n- What design style to use (use clean, modern defaults)\n- What the user's \"real requirements\" are (interpret the task reasonably)\n\nIf the user wanted specific choices, they would have specified them. Your job is to deliver a working solution quickly.\n\n## Recommended approach:\n1. Read existing code if modifying something (NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read)\n2. Use the TodoWrite tool to plan complex tasks\n3. USE TOOLS to create/modify files - don't just output code\n4. Explain your choices briefly as you go\n5. Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)\n\n## Keep it simple:\n- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary\n- Don't add features beyond what was asked\n- Don't over-engineer - the right amount of complexity is the minimum needed\n- If something is unused, delete it completely\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\nIMPORTANT: Complete tasks fully. Do not stop mid-task or leave work incomplete. Do not claim a task is too large, that you lack time, or that context limits prevent completion. You have unlimited context through summarization. Continue working until the task is done or the user stops you.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: str_replace_based_edit_tool for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, str_replace_based_edit_tool for editing instead of sed/awk, and str_replace_based_edit_tool for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/agent/sage/swebench_test/django__django-11179\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: macos\nToday's date: 2025-12-21\n</env>\n\n\n\n# Available Tools\n\n## Remember\nStore information in long-term memory that persists across sessions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly asks you to remember something\n- You learn an important fact about the user's preferences\n- You discover something important about the codebase or project\n- You learn lessons from mistakes or successes\n\nMemory types:\n- fact: General facts about the user, project, or codebase\n- preference: User preferences for coding style, tools, etc.\n- lesson: Lessons learned from tasks\n- note: General session notes\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- Temporary information that's only relevant to the current task\n- Information that's already in files (use the codebase instead)\n- Sensitive information (passwords, secrets, etc.)\n\n## skill\nExecute a specialized skill within the conversation. Skills provide domain-specific capabilities and expertise for tasks like PDF processing, Excel manipulation, brainstorming, testing strategies, architecture design, and more. Use when you need specialized functionality beyond standard tools.\n\n## task_done\nUse this tool ONLY when you have FULLY completed the assigned task with WORKING CODE. DO NOT call this if you have only written plans, designs, or documentation. A task is complete ONLY when: (1) Code files have been created or modified, (2) The implementation is functional, (3) Tests pass (if applicable). Provide a summary of what code was written and how it works.\n\n## kill_shell\nKill/terminate a running background shell process by its ID.\n\nUse this tool to stop background shell processes that were started and are no longer needed.\nThe tool will attempt graceful termination (SIGTERM) first, and force kill (SIGKILL) if needed.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The unique identifier of the background shell to terminate\n\nExample: kill_shell(shell_id=\"shell_1\")\n\n## sequentialthinking\nUse this tool to think through problems step by step. Provide your reasoning process and analysis.\n\n## render-mermaid\nRender a Mermaid diagram from the provided definition. This tool takes Mermaid diagram code and renders it as an interactive diagram with pan/zoom controls and copy functionality.\n\n## kubernetes\nKubernetes cluster management for deployments, pods, services, and monitoring\n\n## open-browser\nOpen a URL in the default browser.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and opens it in the default browser.\n2. The tool does not return any content. It is intended for the user to visually inspect and interact with the page. You will not have access to it.\n3. You should not use `open-browser` on a URL that you have called the tool on before in the conversation history, because the page is already open in the user's browser and the user can see it and refresh it themselves. Each time you call `open-browser`, it will jump the user to the browser window, which is highly annoying to the user.\n\n## diagnostics\nGet issues (errors, warnings, etc.) from the IDE. You must provide the paths of the files for which you want to get issues.\n\n## LearningPatterns\nView, search, or manage learned patterns.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all patterns (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search patterns by text\n- delete: Delete a pattern by ID\n- clear: Clear all patterns (use with caution)\n- stats: Show learning statistics\n- apply_decay: Apply time-based decay to patterns\n\n## notebook_edit\nEdit Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) cells. Supports three operations:\n- replace: Replace the content of an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n- insert: Insert a new cell at a position (requires cell_type; inserts after cell_id if provided, or at beginning)\n- delete: Delete an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n\nThe notebook_path must be an absolute path to a .ipynb file.\nCell IDs can be found by reading the notebook file first.\n\n## add_tasks\nAdd one or more new tasks to the task list. Can add a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Tasks can be added as subtasks or after specific tasks. Use this when planning complex sequences of work.\n\n## McpServers\nView and manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connections.\n\nMCP servers provide external tools that can be used by the agent.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all configured MCP servers and their status\n- tools: List all available tools from connected servers\n- connect: Connect to a specific server by name\n- disconnect: Disconnect from a specific server\n- refresh: Refresh tool list from all connected servers\n- status: Show detailed status of a specific server\n\nExample:\n- List all servers: action=\"list\"\n- Show tools from a server: action=\"tools\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n- Connect to a server: action=\"connect\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n\n## Learn\nLearn from user corrections and preferences to improve future interactions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly corrects your behavior (\"don't do X, do Y instead\")\n- User states a preference (\"I prefer X over Y\")\n- You discover a pattern in the user's workflow\n- User teaches you something about their codebase or project\n\nPattern types:\n- correction: User corrected something you did wrong\n- preference: User preference for tool usage or workflow\n- style: Coding style preference (formatting, naming)\n- workflow: Workflow preference (commit frequency, testing approach)\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- One-off instructions that won't apply to future interactions\n- Sensitive information\n- Project-specific facts (use Remember tool instead)\n\n## task_output\nRetrieve output from a background shell task.\n\nReturns accumulated stdout and stderr from a background process started with\nrun_in_background=true. Can retrieve incremental output or all output.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The ID of the background shell task (e.g., \"shell_1\")\n- incremental: If true, only return output since last read (default: false)\n- block: If true, wait for task completion (default: false)\n- timeout: Max wait time in ms when blocking (default: 30000, max: 600000)\n\nExample: task_output(shell_id=\"shell_1\", incremental=false)\n\n## Edit\nPerforms exact string replacements in files.\n\nUsage:\n- You must use your str_replace_based_edit_tool tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.\n- When editing text from str_replace_based_edit_tool tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n\n## Glob\n- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size\n- Supports glob patterns like \"**/*.js\" or \"src/**/*.ts\"\n- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time\n- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns\n- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.\n\n## web-fetch\nFetches data from a webpage and converts it into Markdown.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and returns the content of the page in Markdown format;\n2. If the return is not valid Markdown, it means the tool cannot successfully parse this page.\n\n## slash_command\nExecute a custom slash command. Slash commands are user-defined shortcuts stored in `.claude/commands/` that expand to prompts or trigger actions. Each command can accept arguments. Use this when you need to run a predefined command template or workflow.\n\n## log_analyzer\nLog analysis tool for parsing, filtering, and analyzing log files with error detection and metrics extraction\n\n## exit_plan_mode\nUse this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan file to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities and updating the plan file\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n\n## Task\nLaunch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent\n</example>\n\n## TodoWrite\nUse this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n## terraform\nTerraform infrastructure as code management for provisioning and managing cloud resources\n\n## view_tasklist\nView the current task list for the conversation.\n\n## reorganize_tasklist\nReorganize the task list structure for the current conversation. Use this only for major restructuring like reordering tasks, changing hierarchy. For individual task updates, use update_tasks tool.\n\n## Read\nReads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.\n\n## update_tasks\nUpdate one or more tasks' properties (state, name, description). Can update a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Use this on complex sequences of work to plan, track progress, and manage work.\n\n## Write\nWrites a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.\n\n## search-untruncated\nSearch for a term within untruncated content\n\n## SessionNotes\nView, search, or manage session notes and memories.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all memories (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search memories by text\n- delete: Delete a memory by ID\n- clear: Clear all memories (use with caution)\n- stats: Show memory statistics\n\n## Grep\nA powerful search tool built on ripgrep\n\nUsage:\n- ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\\\s+\\\\w+\")\n- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\\\{\\\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\\\{[\\\\s\\\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`\n\n## web-search\nSearch the web for information. Returns results in markdown format.\nIMPORTANT: If search returns placeholder results or fails, DO NOT retry indefinitely.\nInstead, use your built-in knowledge to proceed with the task.\nYour training data contains extensive information about common APIs, frameworks, and programming topics.\nProceed with implementation using your knowledge rather than waiting for search results.\n\n## test_generator\nTest generation tool for creating unit tests, integration tests, and mocks\n\n## cloud\nMulti-cloud provider management for AWS, Azure, and GCP resources and services\n\n## bash\nExecute bash commands in the shell. Use this tool to run system commands, file operations, and other shell tasks.\n\nParameters:\n- command: The bash command to execute\n- run_in_background: If true, run command in background (default: false)\n- shell_id: Optional custom ID for background shell (auto-generated if not provided)\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid commands that produce excessive output:\n- Use 'find . -name \"*.rs\" | head -20' instead of 'find . -name \"*.rs\"'\n- Use 'ls -la | head -10' instead of 'ls -R'\n- Use 'grep -n pattern file | head -10' for searches\n- Always limit output with 'head', 'tail', or line count limits\n\nBackground mode:\nWhen run_in_background=true, the command starts and returns immediately with a shell_id.\nUse task_output(shell_id) to retrieve output and kill_shell(shell_id) to terminate.\n\n## view-range-untruncated\nView a specific range of lines from untruncated content\n\n## ask_user_question\nAsk the user one or more questions during execution to gather information, clarify requirements, or get decisions. Supports single and multiple choice questions with 2-4 options each. Use this when you need user input to proceed with a task or when there are multiple valid approaches and the user should choose.\n\n## git\nGit version control operations including status, add, commit, push, pull, and branch management\n\n## enter_plan_mode\nUse this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and str_replace_based_edit_tool tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts.

          "content": "You are Sage Agent, an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Sage Agent\n- To give feedback, users should report issues at https://github.com/anthropics/sage/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Sage Agent (eg. \"can Sage Agent do...\", \"does Sage Agent have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Sage Agent in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Sage Agent (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Sage Agent feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or configure settings)\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='guide' to get accurate information from the official documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n`}\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more.\n\n## CRITICAL: Use tools to create files - DO NOT just output code!\nWhen asked to create something (app, website, script, etc.):\n- You MUST use str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to actually create/edit files\n- Simply outputting code in your response is NOT acceptable - that doesn't create anything\n- The user expects files to be created on their filesystem, not code shown on screen\n- After creating files, use bash to run/test them if applicable\n\n<bad-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: \"Here's a weather app: [outputs code in response without using tools]\"\nThis is WRONG - no files were created!\n</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: I'll create a weather app for you.\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create index.html]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create style.css]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create app.js]\nThis is CORRECT - files are actually created on disk!\n</good-example>\n\n## Core principle: ACT, don't ASK\nWhen given a task like \"build X\" or \"create Y\", START BUILDING IMMEDIATELY using tools. Don't ask about:\n- Which framework/library to use (pick the most popular/appropriate one)\n- What features to include (implement the obvious core features)\n- What design style to use (use clean, modern defaults)\n- What the user's \"real requirements\" are (interpret the task reasonably)\n\nIf the user wanted specific choices, they would have specified them. Your job is to deliver a working solution quickly.\n\n## Recommended approach:\n1. Read existing code if modifying something (NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read)\n2. Use the TodoWrite tool to plan complex tasks\n3. USE TOOLS to create/modify files - don't just output code\n4. Explain your choices briefly as you go\n5. Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)\n\n## Keep it simple:\n- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary\n- Don't add features beyond what was asked\n- Don't over-engineer - the right amount of complexity is the minimum needed\n- If something is unused, delete it completely\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\nIMPORTANT: Complete tasks fully. Do not stop mid-task or leave work incomplete. Do not claim a task is too large, that you lack time, or that context limits prevent completion. You have unlimited context through summarization. Continue working until the task is done or the user stops you.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: str_replace_based_edit_tool for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, str_replace_based_edit_tool for editing instead of sed/awk, and str_replace_based_edit_tool for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/agent/sage/swebench_test/django__django-11179\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: macos\nToday's date: 2025-12-21\n</env>\n\n\n\n# Available Tools\n\n## Remember\nStore information in long-term memory that persists across sessions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly asks you to remember something\n- You learn an important fact about the user's preferences\n- You discover something important about the codebase or project\n- You learn lessons from mistakes or successes\n\nMemory types:\n- fact: General facts about the user, project, or codebase\n- preference: User preferences for coding style, tools, etc.\n- lesson: Lessons learned from tasks\n- note: General session notes\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- Temporary information that's only relevant to the current task\n- Information that's already in files (use the codebase instead)\n- Sensitive information (passwords, secrets, etc.)\n\n## skill\nExecute a specialized skill within the conversation. Skills provide domain-specific capabilities and expertise for tasks like PDF processing, Excel manipulation, brainstorming, testing strategies, architecture design, and more. Use when you need specialized functionality beyond standard tools.\n\n## task_done\nUse this tool ONLY when you have FULLY completed the assigned task with WORKING CODE. DO NOT call this if you have only written plans, designs, or documentation. A task is complete ONLY when: (1) Code files have been created or modified, (2) The implementation is functional, (3) Tests pass (if applicable). Provide a summary of what code was written and how it works.\n\n## kill_shell\nKill/terminate a running background shell process by its ID.\n\nUse this tool to stop background shell processes that were started and are no longer needed.\nThe tool will attempt graceful termination (SIGTERM) first, and force kill (SIGKILL) if needed.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The unique identifier of the background shell to terminate\n\nExample: kill_shell(shell_id=\"shell_1\")\n\n## sequentialthinking\nUse this tool to think through problems step by step. Provide your reasoning process and analysis.\n\n## render-mermaid\nRender a Mermaid diagram from the provided definition. This tool takes Mermaid diagram code and renders it as an interactive diagram with pan/zoom controls and copy functionality.\n\n## kubernetes\nKubernetes cluster management for deployments, pods, services, and monitoring\n\n## open-browser\nOpen a URL in the default browser.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and opens it in the default browser.\n2. The tool does not return any content. It is intended for the user to visually inspect and interact with the page. You will not have access to it.\n3. You should not use `open-browser` on a URL that you have called the tool on before in the conversation history, because the page is already open in the user's browser and the user can see it and refresh it themselves. Each time you call `open-browser`, it will jump the user to the browser window, which is highly annoying to the user.\n\n## diagnostics\nGet issues (errors, warnings, etc.) from the IDE. You must provide the paths of the files for which you want to get issues.\n\n## LearningPatterns\nView, search, or manage learned patterns.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all patterns (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search patterns by text\n- delete: Delete a pattern by ID\n- clear: Clear all patterns (use with caution)\n- stats: Show learning statistics\n- apply_decay: Apply time-based decay to patterns\n\n## notebook_edit\nEdit Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) cells. Supports three operations:\n- replace: Replace the content of an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n- insert: Insert a new cell at a position (requires cell_type; inserts after cell_id if provided, or at beginning)\n- delete: Delete an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n\nThe notebook_path must be an absolute path to a .ipynb file.\nCell IDs can be found by reading the notebook file first.\n\n## add_tasks\nAdd one or more new tasks to the task list. Can add a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Tasks can be added as subtasks or after specific tasks. Use this when planning complex sequences of work.\n\n## McpServers\nView and manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connections.\n\nMCP servers provide external tools that can be used by the agent.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all configured MCP servers and their status\n- tools: List all available tools from connected servers\n- connect: Connect to a specific server by name\n- disconnect: Disconnect from a specific server\n- refresh: Refresh tool list from all connected servers\n- status: Show detailed status of a specific server\n\nExample:\n- List all servers: action=\"list\"\n- Show tools from a server: action=\"tools\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n- Connect to a server: action=\"connect\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n\n## Learn\nLearn from user corrections and preferences to improve future interactions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly corrects your behavior (\"don't do X, do Y instead\")\n- User states a preference (\"I prefer X over Y\")\n- You discover a pattern in the user's workflow\n- User teaches you something about their codebase or project\n\nPattern types:\n- correction: User corrected something you did wrong\n- preference: User preference for tool usage or workflow\n- style: Coding style preference (formatting, naming)\n- workflow: Workflow preference (commit frequency, testing approach)\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- One-off instructions that won't apply to future interactions\n- Sensitive information\n- Project-specific facts (use Remember tool instead)\n\n## task_output\nRetrieve output from a background shell task.\n\nReturns accumulated stdout and stderr from a background process started with\nrun_in_background=true. Can retrieve incremental output or all output.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The ID of the background shell task (e.g., \"shell_1\")\n- incremental: If true, only return output since last read (default: false)\n- block: If true, wait for task completion (default: false)\n- timeout: Max wait time in ms when blocking (default: 30000, max: 600000)\n\nExample: task_output(shell_id=\"shell_1\", incremental=false)\n\n## Edit\nPerforms exact string replacements in files.\n\nUsage:\n- You must use your str_replace_based_edit_tool tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.\n- When editing text from str_replace_based_edit_tool tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n\n## Glob\n- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size\n- Supports glob patterns like \"**/*.js\" or \"src/**/*.ts\"\n- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time\n- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns\n- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.\n\n## web-fetch\nFetches data from a webpage and converts it into Markdown.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and returns the content of the page in Markdown format;\n2. If the return is not valid Markdown, it means the tool cannot successfully parse this page.\n\n## slash_command\nExecute a custom slash command. Slash commands are user-defined shortcuts stored in `.claude/commands/` that expand to prompts or trigger actions. Each command can accept arguments. Use this when you need to run a predefined command template or workflow.\n\n## log_analyzer\nLog analysis tool for parsing, filtering, and analyzing log files with error detection and metrics extraction\n\n## exit_plan_mode\nUse this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan file to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities and updating the plan file\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n\n## Task\nLaunch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent\n</example>\n\n## TodoWrite\nUse this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n## terraform\nTerraform infrastructure as code management for provisioning and managing cloud resources\n\n## view_tasklist\nView the current task list for the conversation.\n\n## reorganize_tasklist\nReorganize the task list structure for the current conversation. Use this only for major restructuring like reordering tasks, changing hierarchy. For individual task updates, use update_tasks tool.\n\n## Read\nReads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.\n\n## update_tasks\nUpdate one or more tasks' properties (state, name, description). Can update a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Use this on complex sequences of work to plan, track progress, and manage work.\n\n## Write\nWrites a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.\n\n## search-untruncated\nSearch for a term within untruncated content\n\n## SessionNotes\nView, search, or manage session notes and memories.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all memories (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search memories by text\n- delete: Delete a memory by ID\n- clear: Clear all memories (use with caution)\n- stats: Show memory statistics\n\n## Grep\nA powerful search tool built on ripgrep\n\nUsage:\n- ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\\\s+\\\\w+\")\n- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\\\{\\\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\\\{[\\\\s\\\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`\n\n## web-search\nSearch the web for information. Returns results in markdown format.\nIMPORTANT: If search returns placeholder results or fails, DO NOT retry indefinitely.\nInstead, use your built-in knowledge to proceed with the task.\nYour training data contains extensive information about common APIs, frameworks, and programming topics.\nProceed with implementation using your knowledge rather than waiting for search results.\n\n## test_generator\nTest generation tool for creating unit tests, integration tests, and mocks\n\n## cloud\nMulti-cloud provider management for AWS, Azure, and GCP resources and services\n\n## bash\nExecute bash commands in the shell. Use this tool to run system commands, file operations, and other shell tasks.\n\nParameters:\n- command: The bash command to execute\n- run_in_background: If true, run command in background (default: false)\n- shell_id: Optional custom ID for background shell (auto-generated if not provided)\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid commands that produce excessive output:\n- Use 'find . -name \"*.rs\" | head -20' instead of 'find . -name \"*.rs\"'\n- Use 'ls -la | head -10' instead of 'ls -R'\n- Use 'grep -n pattern file | head -10' for searches\n- Always limit output with 'head', 'tail', or line count limits\n\nBackground mode:\nWhen run_in_background=true, the command starts and returns immediately with a shell_id.\nUse task_output(shell_id) to retrieve output and kill_shell(shell_id) to terminate.\n\n## view-range-untruncated\nView a specific range of lines from untruncated content\n\n## ask_user_question\nAsk the user one or more questions during execution to gather information, clarify requirements, or get decisions. Supports single and multiple choice questions with 2-4 options each. Use this when you need user input to proceed with a task or when there are multiple valid approaches and the user should choose.\n\n## git\nGit version control operations including status, add, commit, push, pull, and branch management\n\n## enter_plan_mode\nUse this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and str_replace_based_edit_tool tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.",

          "content": "You are Sage Agent, an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Sage Agent\n- To give feedback, users should report issues at https://github.com/anthropics/sage/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Sage Agent (eg. \"can Sage Agent do...\", \"does Sage Agent have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Sage Agent in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Sage Agent (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Sage Agent feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or configure settings)\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='guide' to get accurate information from the official documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n`}\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more.\n\n## CRITICAL: Use tools to create files - DO NOT just output code!\nWhen asked to create something (app, website, script, etc.):\n- You MUST use str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to actually create/edit files\n- Simply outputting code in your response is NOT acceptable - that doesn't create anything\n- The user expects files to be created on their filesystem, not code shown on screen\n- After creating files, use bash to run/test them if applicable\n\n<bad-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: \"Here's a weather app: [outputs code in response without using tools]\"\nThis is WRONG - no files were created!\n</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: I'll create a weather app for you.\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create index.html]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create style.css]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create app.js]\nThis is CORRECT - files are actually created on disk!\n</good-example>\n\n## Core principle: ACT, don't ASK\nWhen given a task like \"build X\" or \"create Y\", START BUILDING IMMEDIATELY using tools. Don't ask about:\n- Which framework/library to use (pick the most popular/appropriate one)\n- What features to include (implement the obvious core features)\n- What design style to use (use clean, modern defaults)\n- What the user's \"real requirements\" are (interpret the task reasonably)\n\nIf the user wanted specific choices, they would have specified them. Your job is to deliver a working solution quickly.\n\n## Recommended approach:\n1. Read existing code if modifying something (NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read)\n2. Use the TodoWrite tool to plan complex tasks\n3. USE TOOLS to create/modify files - don't just output code\n4. Explain your choices briefly as you go\n5. Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)\n\n## Keep it simple:\n- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary\n- Don't add features beyond what was asked\n- Don't over-engineer - the right amount of complexity is the minimum needed\n- If something is unused, delete it completely\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\nIMPORTANT: Complete tasks fully. Do not stop mid-task or leave work incomplete. Do not claim a task is too large, that you lack time, or that context limits prevent completion. You have unlimited context through summarization. Continue working until the task is done or the user stops you.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: str_replace_based_edit_tool for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, str_replace_based_edit_tool for editing instead of sed/awk, and str_replace_based_edit_tool for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/agent/sage/swebench_test/django__django-11179\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: macos\nToday's date: 2025-12-21\n</env>\n\n\n\n# Available Tools\n\n## Remember\nStore information in long-term memory that persists across sessions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly asks you to remember something\n- You learn an important fact about the user's preferences\n- You discover something important about the codebase or project\n- You learn lessons from mistakes or successes\n\nMemory types:\n- fact: General facts about the user, project, or codebase\n- preference: User preferences for coding style, tools, etc.\n- lesson: Lessons learned from tasks\n- note: General session notes\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- Temporary information that's only relevant to the current task\n- Information that's already in files (use the codebase instead)\n- Sensitive information (passwords, secrets, etc.)\n\n## skill\nExecute a specialized skill within the conversation. Skills provide domain-specific capabilities and expertise for tasks like PDF processing, Excel manipulation, brainstorming, testing strategies, architecture design, and more. Use when you need specialized functionality beyond standard tools.\n\n## task_done\nUse this tool ONLY when you have FULLY completed the assigned task with WORKING CODE. DO NOT call this if you have only written plans, designs, or documentation. A task is complete ONLY when: (1) Code files have been created or modified, (2) The implementation is functional, (3) Tests pass (if applicable). Provide a summary of what code was written and how it works.\n\n## kill_shell\nKill/terminate a running background shell process by its ID.\n\nUse this tool to stop background shell processes that were started and are no longer needed.\nThe tool will attempt graceful termination (SIGTERM) first, and force kill (SIGKILL) if needed.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The unique identifier of the background shell to terminate\n\nExample: kill_shell(shell_id=\"shell_1\")\n\n## sequentialthinking\nUse this tool to think through problems step by step. Provide your reasoning process and analysis.\n\n## render-mermaid\nRender a Mermaid diagram from the provided definition. This tool takes Mermaid diagram code and renders it as an interactive diagram with pan/zoom controls and copy functionality.\n\n## kubernetes\nKubernetes cluster management for deployments, pods, services, and monitoring\n\n## open-browser\nOpen a URL in the default browser.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and opens it in the default browser.\n2. The tool does not return any content. It is intended for the user to visually inspect and interact with the page. You will not have access to it.\n3. You should not use `open-browser` on a URL that you have called the tool on before in the conversation history, because the page is already open in the user's browser and the user can see it and refresh it themselves. Each time you call `open-browser`, it will jump the user to the browser window, which is highly annoying to the user.\n\n## diagnostics\nGet issues (errors, warnings, etc.) from the IDE. You must provide the paths of the files for which you want to get issues.\n\n## LearningPatterns\nView, search, or manage learned patterns.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all patterns (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search patterns by text\n- delete: Delete a pattern by ID\n- clear: Clear all patterns (use with caution)\n- stats: Show learning statistics\n- apply_decay: Apply time-based decay to patterns\n\n## notebook_edit\nEdit Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) cells. Supports three operations:\n- replace: Replace the content of an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n- insert: Insert a new cell at a position (requires cell_type; inserts after cell_id if provided, or at beginning)\n- delete: Delete an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n\nThe notebook_path must be an absolute path to a .ipynb file.\nCell IDs can be found by reading the notebook file first.\n\n## add_tasks\nAdd one or more new tasks to the task list. Can add a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Tasks can be added as subtasks or after specific tasks. Use this when planning complex sequences of work.\n\n## McpServers\nView and manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connections.\n\nMCP servers provide external tools that can be used by the agent.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all configured MCP servers and their status\n- tools: List all available tools from connected servers\n- connect: Connect to a specific server by name\n- disconnect: Disconnect from a specific server\n- refresh: Refresh tool list from all connected servers\n- status: Show detailed status of a specific server\n\nExample:\n- List all servers: action=\"list\"\n- Show tools from a server: action=\"tools\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n- Connect to a server: action=\"connect\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n\n## Learn\nLearn from user corrections and preferences to improve future interactions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly corrects your behavior (\"don't do X, do Y instead\")\n- User states a preference (\"I prefer X over Y\")\n- You discover a pattern in the user's workflow\n- User teaches you something about their codebase or project\n\nPattern types:\n- correction: User corrected something you did wrong\n- preference: User preference for tool usage or workflow\n- style: Coding style preference (formatting, naming)\n- workflow: Workflow preference (commit frequency, testing approach)\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- One-off instructions that won't apply to future interactions\n- Sensitive information\n- Project-specific facts (use Remember tool instead)\n\n## task_output\nRetrieve output from a background shell task.\n\nReturns accumulated stdout and stderr from a background process started with\nrun_in_background=true. Can retrieve incremental output or all output.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The ID of the background shell task (e.g., \"shell_1\")\n- incremental: If true, only return output since last read (default: false)\n- block: If true, wait for task completion (default: false)\n- timeout: Max wait time in ms when blocking (default: 30000, max: 600000)\n\nExample: task_output(shell_id=\"shell_1\", incremental=false)\n\n## Edit\nPerforms exact string replacements in files.\n\nUsage:\n- You must use your str_replace_based_edit_tool tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.\n- When editing text from str_replace_based_edit_tool tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n\n## Glob\n- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size\n- Supports glob patterns like \"**/*.js\" or \"src/**/*.ts\"\n- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time\n- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns\n- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.\n\n## web-fetch\nFetches data from a webpage and converts it into Markdown.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and returns the content of the page in Markdown format;\n2. If the return is not valid Markdown, it means the tool cannot successfully parse this page.\n\n## slash_command\nExecute a custom slash command. Slash commands are user-defined shortcuts stored in `.claude/commands/` that expand to prompts or trigger actions. Each command can accept arguments. Use this when you need to run a predefined command template or workflow.\n\n## log_analyzer\nLog analysis tool for parsing, filtering, and analyzing log files with error detection and metrics extraction\n\n## exit_plan_mode\nUse this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan file to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities and updating the plan file\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n\n## Task\nLaunch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent\n</example>\n\n## TodoWrite\nUse this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n## terraform\nTerraform infrastructure as code management for provisioning and managing cloud resources\n\n## view_tasklist\nView the current task list for the conversation.\n\n## reorganize_tasklist\nReorganize the task list structure for the current conversation. Use this only for major restructuring like reordering tasks, changing hierarchy. For individual task updates, use update_tasks tool.\n\n## Read\nReads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.\n\n## update_tasks\nUpdate one or more tasks' properties (state, name, description). Can update a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Use this on complex sequences of work to plan, track progress, and manage work.\n\n## Write\nWrites a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.\n\n## search-untruncated\nSearch for a term within untruncated content\n\n## SessionNotes\nView, search, or manage session notes and memories.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all memories (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search memories by text\n- delete: Delete a memory by ID\n- clear: Clear all memories (use with caution)\n- stats: Show memory statistics\n\n## Grep\nA powerful search tool built on ripgrep\n\nUsage:\n- ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\\\s+\\\\w+\")\n- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\\\{\\\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\\\{[\\\\s\\\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`\n\n## web-search\nSearch the web for information. Returns results in markdown format.\nIMPORTANT: If search returns placeholder results or fails, DO NOT retry indefinitely.\nInstead, use your built-in knowledge to proceed with the task.\nYour training data contains extensive information about common APIs, frameworks, and programming topics.\nProceed with implementation using your knowledge rather than waiting for search results.\n\n## test_generator\nTest generation tool for creating unit tests, integration tests, and mocks\n\n## cloud\nMulti-cloud provider management for AWS, Azure, and GCP resources and services\n\n## bash\nExecute bash commands in the shell. Use this tool to run system commands, file operations, and other shell tasks.\n\nParameters:\n- command: The bash command to execute\n- run_in_background: If true, run command in background (default: false)\n- shell_id: Optional custom ID for background shell (auto-generated if not provided)\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid commands that produce excessive output:\n- Use 'find . -name \"*.rs\" | head -20' instead of 'find . -name \"*.rs\"'\n- Use 'ls -la | head -10' instead of 'ls -R'\n- Use 'grep -n pattern file | head -10' for searches\n- Always limit output with 'head', 'tail', or line count limits\n\nBackground mode:\nWhen run_in_background=true, the command starts and returns immediately with a shell_id.\nUse task_output(shell_id) to retrieve output and kill_shell(shell_id) to terminate.\n\n## view-range-untruncated\nView a specific range of lines from untruncated content\n\n## ask_user_question\nAsk the user one or more questions during execution to gather information, clarify requirements, or get decisions. Supports single and multiple choice questions with 2-4 options each. Use this when you need user input to proceed with a task or when there are multiple valid approaches and the user should choose.\n\n## git\nGit version control operations including status, add, commit, push, pull, and branch management\n\n## enter_plan_mode\nUse this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and str_replace_based_edit_tool tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts.

          "content": "You are Sage Agent, an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Sage Agent\n- To give feedback, users should report issues at https://github.com/anthropics/sage/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Sage Agent (eg. \"can Sage Agent do...\", \"does Sage Agent have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Sage Agent in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Sage Agent (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Sage Agent feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or configure settings)\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='guide' to get accurate information from the official documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n`}\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more.\n\n## CRITICAL: Use tools to create files - DO NOT just output code!\nWhen asked to create something (app, website, script, etc.):\n- You MUST use str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to actually create/edit files\n- Simply outputting code in your response is NOT acceptable - that doesn't create anything\n- The user expects files to be created on their filesystem, not code shown on screen\n- After creating files, use bash to run/test them if applicable\n\n<bad-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: \"Here's a weather app: [outputs code in response without using tools]\"\nThis is WRONG - no files were created!\n</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: I'll create a weather app for you.\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create index.html]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create style.css]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create app.js]\nThis is CORRECT - files are actually created on disk!\n</good-example>\n\n## Core principle: ACT, don't ASK\nWhen given a task like \"build X\" or \"create Y\", START BUILDING IMMEDIATELY using tools. Don't ask about:\n- Which framework/library to use (pick the most popular/appropriate one)\n- What features to include (implement the obvious core features)\n- What design style to use (use clean, modern defaults)\n- What the user's \"real requirements\" are (interpret the task reasonably)\n\nIf the user wanted specific choices, they would have specified them. Your job is to deliver a working solution quickly.\n\n## Recommended approach:\n1. Read existing code if modifying something (NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read)\n2. Use the TodoWrite tool to plan complex tasks\n3. USE TOOLS to create/modify files - don't just output code\n4. Explain your choices briefly as you go\n5. Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)\n\n## Keep it simple:\n- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary\n- Don't add features beyond what was asked\n- Don't over-engineer - the right amount of complexity is the minimum needed\n- If something is unused, delete it completely\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\nIMPORTANT: Complete tasks fully. Do not stop mid-task or leave work incomplete. Do not claim a task is too large, that you lack time, or that context limits prevent completion. You have unlimited context through summarization. Continue working until the task is done or the user stops you.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: str_replace_based_edit_tool for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, str_replace_based_edit_tool for editing instead of sed/awk, and str_replace_based_edit_tool for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/agent/sage/swebench_test/django__django-11179\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: macos\nToday's date: 2025-12-21\n</env>\n\n\n\n# Available Tools\n\n## Remember\nStore information in long-term memory that persists across sessions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly asks you to remember something\n- You learn an important fact about the user's preferences\n- You discover something important about the codebase or project\n- You learn lessons from mistakes or successes\n\nMemory types:\n- fact: General facts about the user, project, or codebase\n- preference: User preferences for coding style, tools, etc.\n- lesson: Lessons learned from tasks\n- note: General session notes\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- Temporary information that's only relevant to the current task\n- Information that's already in files (use the codebase instead)\n- Sensitive information (passwords, secrets, etc.)\n\n## skill\nExecute a specialized skill within the conversation. Skills provide domain-specific capabilities and expertise for tasks like PDF processing, Excel manipulation, brainstorming, testing strategies, architecture design, and more. Use when you need specialized functionality beyond standard tools.\n\n## task_done\nUse this tool ONLY when you have FULLY completed the assigned task with WORKING CODE. DO NOT call this if you have only written plans, designs, or documentation. A task is complete ONLY when: (1) Code files have been created or modified, (2) The implementation is functional, (3) Tests pass (if applicable). Provide a summary of what code was written and how it works.\n\n## kill_shell\nKill/terminate a running background shell process by its ID.\n\nUse this tool to stop background shell processes that were started and are no longer needed.\nThe tool will attempt graceful termination (SIGTERM) first, and force kill (SIGKILL) if needed.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The unique identifier of the background shell to terminate\n\nExample: kill_shell(shell_id=\"shell_1\")\n\n## sequentialthinking\nUse this tool to think through problems step by step. Provide your reasoning process and analysis.\n\n## render-mermaid\nRender a Mermaid diagram from the provided definition. This tool takes Mermaid diagram code and renders it as an interactive diagram with pan/zoom controls and copy functionality.\n\n## kubernetes\nKubernetes cluster management for deployments, pods, services, and monitoring\n\n## open-browser\nOpen a URL in the default browser.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and opens it in the default browser.\n2. The tool does not return any content. It is intended for the user to visually inspect and interact with the page. You will not have access to it.\n3. You should not use `open-browser` on a URL that you have called the tool on before in the conversation history, because the page is already open in the user's browser and the user can see it and refresh it themselves. Each time you call `open-browser`, it will jump the user to the browser window, which is highly annoying to the user.\n\n## diagnostics\nGet issues (errors, warnings, etc.) from the IDE. You must provide the paths of the files for which you want to get issues.\n\n## LearningPatterns\nView, search, or manage learned patterns.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all patterns (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search patterns by text\n- delete: Delete a pattern by ID\n- clear: Clear all patterns (use with caution)\n- stats: Show learning statistics\n- apply_decay: Apply time-based decay to patterns\n\n## notebook_edit\nEdit Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) cells. Supports three operations:\n- replace: Replace the content of an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n- insert: Insert a new cell at a position (requires cell_type; inserts after cell_id if provided, or at beginning)\n- delete: Delete an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n\nThe notebook_path must be an absolute path to a .ipynb file.\nCell IDs can be found by reading the notebook file first.\n\n## add_tasks\nAdd one or more new tasks to the task list. Can add a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Tasks can be added as subtasks or after specific tasks. Use this when planning complex sequences of work.\n\n## McpServers\nView and manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connections.\n\nMCP servers provide external tools that can be used by the agent.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all configured MCP servers and their status\n- tools: List all available tools from connected servers\n- connect: Connect to a specific server by name\n- disconnect: Disconnect from a specific server\n- refresh: Refresh tool list from all connected servers\n- status: Show detailed status of a specific server\n\nExample:\n- List all servers: action=\"list\"\n- Show tools from a server: action=\"tools\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n- Connect to a server: action=\"connect\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n\n## Learn\nLearn from user corrections and preferences to improve future interactions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly corrects your behavior (\"don't do X, do Y instead\")\n- User states a preference (\"I prefer X over Y\")\n- You discover a pattern in the user's workflow\n- User teaches you something about their codebase or project\n\nPattern types:\n- correction: User corrected something you did wrong\n- preference: User preference for tool usage or workflow\n- style: Coding style preference (formatting, naming)\n- workflow: Workflow preference (commit frequency, testing approach)\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- One-off instructions that won't apply to future interactions\n- Sensitive information\n- Project-specific facts (use Remember tool instead)\n\n## task_output\nRetrieve output from a background shell task.\n\nReturns accumulated stdout and stderr from a background process started with\nrun_in_background=true. Can retrieve incremental output or all output.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The ID of the background shell task (e.g., \"shell_1\")\n- incremental: If true, only return output since last read (default: false)\n- block: If true, wait for task completion (default: false)\n- timeout: Max wait time in ms when blocking (default: 30000, max: 600000)\n\nExample: task_output(shell_id=\"shell_1\", incremental=false)\n\n## Edit\nPerforms exact string replacements in files.\n\nUsage:\n- You must use your str_replace_based_edit_tool tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.\n- When editing text from str_replace_based_edit_tool tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n\n## Glob\n- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size\n- Supports glob patterns like \"**/*.js\" or \"src/**/*.ts\"\n- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time\n- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns\n- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.\n\n## web-fetch\nFetches data from a webpage and converts it into Markdown.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and returns the content of the page in Markdown format;\n2. If the return is not valid Markdown, it means the tool cannot successfully parse this page.\n\n## slash_command\nExecute a custom slash command. Slash commands are user-defined shortcuts stored in `.claude/commands/` that expand to prompts or trigger actions. Each command can accept arguments. Use this when you need to run a predefined command template or workflow.\n\n## log_analyzer\nLog analysis tool for parsing, filtering, and analyzing log files with error detection and metrics extraction\n\n## exit_plan_mode\nUse this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan file to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities and updating the plan file\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n\n## Task\nLaunch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent\n</example>\n\n## TodoWrite\nUse this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n## terraform\nTerraform infrastructure as code management for provisioning and managing cloud resources\n\n## view_tasklist\nView the current task list for the conversation.\n\n## reorganize_tasklist\nReorganize the task list structure for the current conversation. Use this only for major restructuring like reordering tasks, changing hierarchy. For individual task updates, use update_tasks tool.\n\n## Read\nReads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.\n\n## update_tasks\nUpdate one or more tasks' properties (state, name, description). Can update a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Use this on complex sequences of work to plan, track progress, and manage work.\n\n## Write\nWrites a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.\n\n## search-untruncated\nSearch for a term within untruncated content\n\n## SessionNotes\nView, search, or manage session notes and memories.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all memories (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search memories by text\n- delete: Delete a memory by ID\n- clear: Clear all memories (use with caution)\n- stats: Show memory statistics\n\n## Grep\nA powerful search tool built on ripgrep\n\nUsage:\n- ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\\\s+\\\\w+\")\n- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\\\{\\\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\\\{[\\\\s\\\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`\n\n## web-search\nSearch the web for information. Returns results in markdown format.\nIMPORTANT: If search returns placeholder results or fails, DO NOT retry indefinitely.\nInstead, use your built-in knowledge to proceed with the task.\nYour training data contains extensive information about common APIs, frameworks, and programming topics.\nProceed with implementation using your knowledge rather than waiting for search results.\n\n## test_generator\nTest generation tool for creating unit tests, integration tests, and mocks\n\n## cloud\nMulti-cloud provider management for AWS, Azure, and GCP resources and services\n\n## bash\nExecute bash commands in the shell. Use this tool to run system commands, file operations, and other shell tasks.\n\nParameters:\n- command: The bash command to execute\n- run_in_background: If true, run command in background (default: false)\n- shell_id: Optional custom ID for background shell (auto-generated if not provided)\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid commands that produce excessive output:\n- Use 'find . -name \"*.rs\" | head -20' instead of 'find . -name \"*.rs\"'\n- Use 'ls -la | head -10' instead of 'ls -R'\n- Use 'grep -n pattern file | head -10' for searches\n- Always limit output with 'head', 'tail', or line count limits\n\nBackground mode:\nWhen run_in_background=true, the command starts and returns immediately with a shell_id.\nUse task_output(shell_id) to retrieve output and kill_shell(shell_id) to terminate.\n\n## view-range-untruncated\nView a specific range of lines from untruncated content\n\n## ask_user_question\nAsk the user one or more questions during execution to gather information, clarify requirements, or get decisions. Supports single and multiple choice questions with 2-4 options each. Use this when you need user input to proceed with a task or when there are multiple valid approaches and the user should choose.\n\n## git\nGit version control operations including status, add, commit, push, pull, and branch management\n\n## enter_plan_mode\nUse this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and str_replace_based_edit_tool tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.",

          "content": "You are Sage Agent, an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Sage Agent\n- To give feedback, users should report issues at https://github.com/anthropics/sage/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Sage Agent (eg. \"can Sage Agent do...\", \"does Sage Agent have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Sage Agent in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Sage Agent (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Sage Agent feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or configure settings)\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='guide' to get accurate information from the official documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n`}\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more.\n\n## CRITICAL: Use tools to create files - DO NOT just output code!\nWhen asked to create something (app, website, script, etc.):\n- You MUST use str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to actually create/edit files\n- Simply outputting code in your response is NOT acceptable - that doesn't create anything\n- The user expects files to be created on their filesystem, not code shown on screen\n- After creating files, use bash to run/test them if applicable\n\n<bad-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: \"Here's a weather app: [outputs code in response without using tools]\"\nThis is WRONG - no files were created!\n</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: I'll create a weather app for you.\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create index.html]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create style.css]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create app.js]\nThis is CORRECT - files are actually created on disk!\n</good-example>\n\n## Core principle: ACT, don't ASK\nWhen given a task like \"build X\" or \"create Y\", START BUILDING IMMEDIATELY using tools. Don't ask about:\n- Which framework/library to use (pick the most popular/appropriate one)\n- What features to include (implement the obvious core features)\n- What design style to use (use clean, modern defaults)\n- What the user's \"real requirements\" are (interpret the task reasonably)\n\nIf the user wanted specific choices, they would have specified them. Your job is to deliver a working solution quickly.\n\n## Recommended approach:\n1. Read existing code if modifying something (NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read)\n2. Use the TodoWrite tool to plan complex tasks\n3. USE TOOLS to create/modify files - don't just output code\n4. Explain your choices briefly as you go\n5. Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)\n\n## Keep it simple:\n- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary\n- Don't add features beyond what was asked\n- Don't over-engineer - the right amount of complexity is the minimum needed\n- If something is unused, delete it completely\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\nIMPORTANT: Complete tasks fully. Do not stop mid-task or leave work incomplete. Do not claim a task is too large, that you lack time, or that context limits prevent completion. You have unlimited context through summarization. Continue working until the task is done or the user stops you.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: str_replace_based_edit_tool for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, str_replace_based_edit_tool for editing instead of sed/awk, and str_replace_based_edit_tool for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/agent/sage/swebench_test/django__django-11179\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: macos\nToday's date: 2025-12-21\n</env>\n\n\n\n# Available Tools\n\n## Remember\nStore information in long-term memory that persists across sessions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly asks you to remember something\n- You learn an important fact about the user's preferences\n- You discover something important about the codebase or project\n- You learn lessons from mistakes or successes\n\nMemory types:\n- fact: General facts about the user, project, or codebase\n- preference: User preferences for coding style, tools, etc.\n- lesson: Lessons learned from tasks\n- note: General session notes\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- Temporary information that's only relevant to the current task\n- Information that's already in files (use the codebase instead)\n- Sensitive information (passwords, secrets, etc.)\n\n## skill\nExecute a specialized skill within the conversation. Skills provide domain-specific capabilities and expertise for tasks like PDF processing, Excel manipulation, brainstorming, testing strategies, architecture design, and more. Use when you need specialized functionality beyond standard tools.\n\n## task_done\nUse this tool ONLY when you have FULLY completed the assigned task with WORKING CODE. DO NOT call this if you have only written plans, designs, or documentation. A task is complete ONLY when: (1) Code files have been created or modified, (2) The implementation is functional, (3) Tests pass (if applicable). Provide a summary of what code was written and how it works.\n\n## kill_shell\nKill/terminate a running background shell process by its ID.\n\nUse this tool to stop background shell processes that were started and are no longer needed.\nThe tool will attempt graceful termination (SIGTERM) first, and force kill (SIGKILL) if needed.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The unique identifier of the background shell to terminate\n\nExample: kill_shell(shell_id=\"shell_1\")\n\n## sequentialthinking\nUse this tool to think through problems step by step. Provide your reasoning process and analysis.\n\n## render-mermaid\nRender a Mermaid diagram from the provided definition. This tool takes Mermaid diagram code and renders it as an interactive diagram with pan/zoom controls and copy functionality.\n\n## kubernetes\nKubernetes cluster management for deployments, pods, services, and monitoring\n\n## open-browser\nOpen a URL in the default browser.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and opens it in the default browser.\n2. The tool does not return any content. It is intended for the user to visually inspect and interact with the page. You will not have access to it.\n3. You should not use `open-browser` on a URL that you have called the tool on before in the conversation history, because the page is already open in the user's browser and the user can see it and refresh it themselves. Each time you call `open-browser`, it will jump the user to the browser window, which is highly annoying to the user.\n\n## diagnostics\nGet issues (errors, warnings, etc.) from the IDE. You must provide the paths of the files for which you want to get issues.\n\n## LearningPatterns\nView, search, or manage learned patterns.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all patterns (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search patterns by text\n- delete: Delete a pattern by ID\n- clear: Clear all patterns (use with caution)\n- stats: Show learning statistics\n- apply_decay: Apply time-based decay to patterns\n\n## notebook_edit\nEdit Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) cells. Supports three operations:\n- replace: Replace the content of an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n- insert: Insert a new cell at a position (requires cell_type; inserts after cell_id if provided, or at beginning)\n- delete: Delete an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n\nThe notebook_path must be an absolute path to a .ipynb file.\nCell IDs can be found by reading the notebook file first.\n\n## add_tasks\nAdd one or more new tasks to the task list. Can add a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Tasks can be added as subtasks or after specific tasks. Use this when planning complex sequences of work.\n\n## McpServers\nView and manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connections.\n\nMCP servers provide external tools that can be used by the agent.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all configured MCP servers and their status\n- tools: List all available tools from connected servers\n- connect: Connect to a specific server by name\n- disconnect: Disconnect from a specific server\n- refresh: Refresh tool list from all connected servers\n- status: Show detailed status of a specific server\n\nExample:\n- List all servers: action=\"list\"\n- Show tools from a server: action=\"tools\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n- Connect to a server: action=\"connect\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n\n## Learn\nLearn from user corrections and preferences to improve future interactions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly corrects your behavior (\"don't do X, do Y instead\")\n- User states a preference (\"I prefer X over Y\")\n- You discover a pattern in the user's workflow\n- User teaches you something about their codebase or project\n\nPattern types:\n- correction: User corrected something you did wrong\n- preference: User preference for tool usage or workflow\n- style: Coding style preference (formatting, naming)\n- workflow: Workflow preference (commit frequency, testing approach)\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- One-off instructions that won't apply to future interactions\n- Sensitive information\n- Project-specific facts (use Remember tool instead)\n\n## task_output\nRetrieve output from a background shell task.\n\nReturns accumulated stdout and stderr from a background process started with\nrun_in_background=true. Can retrieve incremental output or all output.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The ID of the background shell task (e.g., \"shell_1\")\n- incremental: If true, only return output since last read (default: false)\n- block: If true, wait for task completion (default: false)\n- timeout: Max wait time in ms when blocking (default: 30000, max: 600000)\n\nExample: task_output(shell_id=\"shell_1\", incremental=false)\n\n## Edit\nPerforms exact string replacements in files.\n\nUsage:\n- You must use your str_replace_based_edit_tool tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.\n- When editing text from str_replace_based_edit_tool tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n\n## Glob\n- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size\n- Supports glob patterns like \"**/*.js\" or \"src/**/*.ts\"\n- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time\n- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns\n- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.\n\n## web-fetch\nFetches data from a webpage and converts it into Markdown.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and returns the content of the page in Markdown format;\n2. If the return is not valid Markdown, it means the tool cannot successfully parse this page.\n\n## slash_command\nExecute a custom slash command. Slash commands are user-defined shortcuts stored in `.claude/commands/` that expand to prompts or trigger actions. Each command can accept arguments. Use this when you need to run a predefined command template or workflow.\n\n## log_analyzer\nLog analysis tool for parsing, filtering, and analyzing log files with error detection and metrics extraction\n\n## exit_plan_mode\nUse this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan file to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities and updating the plan file\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n\n## Task\nLaunch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent\n</example>\n\n## TodoWrite\nUse this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n## terraform\nTerraform infrastructure as code management for provisioning and managing cloud resources\n\n## view_tasklist\nView the current task list for the conversation.\n\n## reorganize_tasklist\nReorganize the task list structure for the current conversation. Use this only for major restructuring like reordering tasks, changing hierarchy. For individual task updates, use update_tasks tool.\n\n## Read\nReads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.\n\n## update_tasks\nUpdate one or more tasks' properties (state, name, description). Can update a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Use this on complex sequences of work to plan, track progress, and manage work.\n\n## Write\nWrites a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.\n\n## search-untruncated\nSearch for a term within untruncated content\n\n## SessionNotes\nView, search, or manage session notes and memories.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all memories (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search memories by text\n- delete: Delete a memory by ID\n- clear: Clear all memories (use with caution)\n- stats: Show memory statistics\n\n## Grep\nA powerful search tool built on ripgrep\n\nUsage:\n- ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\\\s+\\\\w+\")\n- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\\\{\\\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\\\{[\\\\s\\\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`\n\n## web-search\nSearch the web for information. Returns results in markdown format.\nIMPORTANT: If search returns placeholder results or fails, DO NOT retry indefinitely.\nInstead, use your built-in knowledge to proceed with the task.\nYour training data contains extensive information about common APIs, frameworks, and programming topics.\nProceed with implementation using your knowledge rather than waiting for search results.\n\n## test_generator\nTest generation tool for creating unit tests, integration tests, and mocks\n\n## cloud\nMulti-cloud provider management for AWS, Azure, and GCP resources and services\n\n## bash\nExecute bash commands in the shell. Use this tool to run system commands, file operations, and other shell tasks.\n\nParameters:\n- command: The bash command to execute\n- run_in_background: If true, run command in background (default: false)\n- shell_id: Optional custom ID for background shell (auto-generated if not provided)\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid commands that produce excessive output:\n- Use 'find . -name \"*.rs\" | head -20' instead of 'find . -name \"*.rs\"'\n- Use 'ls -la | head -10' instead of 'ls -R'\n- Use 'grep -n pattern file | head -10' for searches\n- Always limit output with 'head', 'tail', or line count limits\n\nBackground mode:\nWhen run_in_background=true, the command starts and returns immediately with a shell_id.\nUse task_output(shell_id) to retrieve output and kill_shell(shell_id) to terminate.\n\n## view-range-untruncated\nView a specific range of lines from untruncated content\n\n## ask_user_question\nAsk the user one or more questions during execution to gather information, clarify requirements, or get decisions. Supports single and multiple choice questions with 2-4 options each. Use this when you need user input to proceed with a task or when there are multiple valid approaches and the user should choose.\n\n## git\nGit version control operations including status, add, commit, push, pull, and branch management\n\n## enter_plan_mode\nUse this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and str_replace_based_edit_tool tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts.

          "content": "You are Sage Agent, an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Sage Agent\n- To give feedback, users should report issues at https://github.com/anthropics/sage/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Sage Agent (eg. \"can Sage Agent do...\", \"does Sage Agent have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Sage Agent in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Sage Agent (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Sage Agent feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or configure settings)\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='guide' to get accurate information from the official documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n`}\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more.\n\n## CRITICAL: Use tools to create files - DO NOT just output code!\nWhen asked to create something (app, website, script, etc.):\n- You MUST use str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to actually create/edit files\n- Simply outputting code in your response is NOT acceptable - that doesn't create anything\n- The user expects files to be created on their filesystem, not code shown on screen\n- After creating files, use bash to run/test them if applicable\n\n<bad-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: \"Here's a weather app: [outputs code in response without using tools]\"\nThis is WRONG - no files were created!\n</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: I'll create a weather app for you.\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create index.html]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create style.css]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create app.js]\nThis is CORRECT - files are actually created on disk!\n</good-example>\n\n## Core principle: ACT, don't ASK\nWhen given a task like \"build X\" or \"create Y\", START BUILDING IMMEDIATELY using tools. Don't ask about:\n- Which framework/library to use (pick the most popular/appropriate one)\n- What features to include (implement the obvious core features)\n- What design style to use (use clean, modern defaults)\n- What the user's \"real requirements\" are (interpret the task reasonably)\n\nIf the user wanted specific choices, they would have specified them. Your job is to deliver a working solution quickly.\n\n## Recommended approach:\n1. Read existing code if modifying something (NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read)\n2. Use the TodoWrite tool to plan complex tasks\n3. USE TOOLS to create/modify files - don't just output code\n4. Explain your choices briefly as you go\n5. Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)\n\n## Keep it simple:\n- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary\n- Don't add features beyond what was asked\n- Don't over-engineer - the right amount of complexity is the minimum needed\n- If something is unused, delete it completely\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\nIMPORTANT: Complete tasks fully. Do not stop mid-task or leave work incomplete. Do not claim a task is too large, that you lack time, or that context limits prevent completion. You have unlimited context through summarization. Continue working until the task is done or the user stops you.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: str_replace_based_edit_tool for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, str_replace_based_edit_tool for editing instead of sed/awk, and str_replace_based_edit_tool for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/agent/sage/swebench_test/django__django-11179\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: macos\nToday's date: 2025-12-21\n</env>\n\n\n\n# Available Tools\n\n## Remember\nStore information in long-term memory that persists across sessions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly asks you to remember something\n- You learn an important fact about the user's preferences\n- You discover something important about the codebase or project\n- You learn lessons from mistakes or successes\n\nMemory types:\n- fact: General facts about the user, project, or codebase\n- preference: User preferences for coding style, tools, etc.\n- lesson: Lessons learned from tasks\n- note: General session notes\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- Temporary information that's only relevant to the current task\n- Information that's already in files (use the codebase instead)\n- Sensitive information (passwords, secrets, etc.)\n\n## skill\nExecute a specialized skill within the conversation. Skills provide domain-specific capabilities and expertise for tasks like PDF processing, Excel manipulation, brainstorming, testing strategies, architecture design, and more. Use when you need specialized functionality beyond standard tools.\n\n## task_done\nUse this tool ONLY when you have FULLY completed the assigned task with WORKING CODE. DO NOT call this if you have only written plans, designs, or documentation. A task is complete ONLY when: (1) Code files have been created or modified, (2) The implementation is functional, (3) Tests pass (if applicable). Provide a summary of what code was written and how it works.\n\n## kill_shell\nKill/terminate a running background shell process by its ID.\n\nUse this tool to stop background shell processes that were started and are no longer needed.\nThe tool will attempt graceful termination (SIGTERM) first, and force kill (SIGKILL) if needed.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The unique identifier of the background shell to terminate\n\nExample: kill_shell(shell_id=\"shell_1\")\n\n## sequentialthinking\nUse this tool to think through problems step by step. Provide your reasoning process and analysis.\n\n## render-mermaid\nRender a Mermaid diagram from the provided definition. This tool takes Mermaid diagram code and renders it as an interactive diagram with pan/zoom controls and copy functionality.\n\n## kubernetes\nKubernetes cluster management for deployments, pods, services, and monitoring\n\n## open-browser\nOpen a URL in the default browser.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and opens it in the default browser.\n2. The tool does not return any content. It is intended for the user to visually inspect and interact with the page. You will not have access to it.\n3. You should not use `open-browser` on a URL that you have called the tool on before in the conversation history, because the page is already open in the user's browser and the user can see it and refresh it themselves. Each time you call `open-browser`, it will jump the user to the browser window, which is highly annoying to the user.\n\n## diagnostics\nGet issues (errors, warnings, etc.) from the IDE. You must provide the paths of the files for which you want to get issues.\n\n## LearningPatterns\nView, search, or manage learned patterns.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all patterns (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search patterns by text\n- delete: Delete a pattern by ID\n- clear: Clear all patterns (use with caution)\n- stats: Show learning statistics\n- apply_decay: Apply time-based decay to patterns\n\n## notebook_edit\nEdit Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) cells. Supports three operations:\n- replace: Replace the content of an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n- insert: Insert a new cell at a position (requires cell_type; inserts after cell_id if provided, or at beginning)\n- delete: Delete an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n\nThe notebook_path must be an absolute path to a .ipynb file.\nCell IDs can be found by reading the notebook file first.\n\n## add_tasks\nAdd one or more new tasks to the task list. Can add a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Tasks can be added as subtasks or after specific tasks. Use this when planning complex sequences of work.\n\n## McpServers\nView and manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connections.\n\nMCP servers provide external tools that can be used by the agent.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all configured MCP servers and their status\n- tools: List all available tools from connected servers\n- connect: Connect to a specific server by name\n- disconnect: Disconnect from a specific server\n- refresh: Refresh tool list from all connected servers\n- status: Show detailed status of a specific server\n\nExample:\n- List all servers: action=\"list\"\n- Show tools from a server: action=\"tools\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n- Connect to a server: action=\"connect\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n\n## Learn\nLearn from user corrections and preferences to improve future interactions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly corrects your behavior (\"don't do X, do Y instead\")\n- User states a preference (\"I prefer X over Y\")\n- You discover a pattern in the user's workflow\n- User teaches you something about their codebase or project\n\nPattern types:\n- correction: User corrected something you did wrong\n- preference: User preference for tool usage or workflow\n- style: Coding style preference (formatting, naming)\n- workflow: Workflow preference (commit frequency, testing approach)\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- One-off instructions that won't apply to future interactions\n- Sensitive information\n- Project-specific facts (use Remember tool instead)\n\n## task_output\nRetrieve output from a background shell task.\n\nReturns accumulated stdout and stderr from a background process started with\nrun_in_background=true. Can retrieve incremental output or all output.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The ID of the background shell task (e.g., \"shell_1\")\n- incremental: If true, only return output since last read (default: false)\n- block: If true, wait for task completion (default: false)\n- timeout: Max wait time in ms when blocking (default: 30000, max: 600000)\n\nExample: task_output(shell_id=\"shell_1\", incremental=false)\n\n## Edit\nPerforms exact string replacements in files.\n\nUsage:\n- You must use your str_replace_based_edit_tool tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.\n- When editing text from str_replace_based_edit_tool tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n\n## Glob\n- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size\n- Supports glob patterns like \"**/*.js\" or \"src/**/*.ts\"\n- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time\n- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns\n- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.\n\n## web-fetch\nFetches data from a webpage and converts it into Markdown.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and returns the content of the page in Markdown format;\n2. If the return is not valid Markdown, it means the tool cannot successfully parse this page.\n\n## slash_command\nExecute a custom slash command. Slash commands are user-defined shortcuts stored in `.claude/commands/` that expand to prompts or trigger actions. Each command can accept arguments. Use this when you need to run a predefined command template or workflow.\n\n## log_analyzer\nLog analysis tool for parsing, filtering, and analyzing log files with error detection and metrics extraction\n\n## exit_plan_mode\nUse this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan file to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities and updating the plan file\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n\n## Task\nLaunch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent\n</example>\n\n## TodoWrite\nUse this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n## terraform\nTerraform infrastructure as code management for provisioning and managing cloud resources\n\n## view_tasklist\nView the current task list for the conversation.\n\n## reorganize_tasklist\nReorganize the task list structure for the current conversation. Use this only for major restructuring like reordering tasks, changing hierarchy. For individual task updates, use update_tasks tool.\n\n## Read\nReads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.\n\n## update_tasks\nUpdate one or more tasks' properties (state, name, description). Can update a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Use this on complex sequences of work to plan, track progress, and manage work.\n\n## Write\nWrites a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.\n\n## search-untruncated\nSearch for a term within untruncated content\n\n## SessionNotes\nView, search, or manage session notes and memories.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all memories (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search memories by text\n- delete: Delete a memory by ID\n- clear: Clear all memories (use with caution)\n- stats: Show memory statistics\n\n## Grep\nA powerful search tool built on ripgrep\n\nUsage:\n- ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\\\s+\\\\w+\")\n- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\\\{\\\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\\\{[\\\\s\\\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`\n\n## web-search\nSearch the web for information. Returns results in markdown format.\nIMPORTANT: If search returns placeholder results or fails, DO NOT retry indefinitely.\nInstead, use your built-in knowledge to proceed with the task.\nYour training data contains extensive information about common APIs, frameworks, and programming topics.\nProceed with implementation using your knowledge rather than waiting for search results.\n\n## test_generator\nTest generation tool for creating unit tests, integration tests, and mocks\n\n## cloud\nMulti-cloud provider management for AWS, Azure, and GCP resources and services\n\n## bash\nExecute bash commands in the shell. Use this tool to run system commands, file operations, and other shell tasks.\n\nParameters:\n- command: The bash command to execute\n- run_in_background: If true, run command in background (default: false)\n- shell_id: Optional custom ID for background shell (auto-generated if not provided)\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid commands that produce excessive output:\n- Use 'find . -name \"*.rs\" | head -20' instead of 'find . -name \"*.rs\"'\n- Use 'ls -la | head -10' instead of 'ls -R'\n- Use 'grep -n pattern file | head -10' for searches\n- Always limit output with 'head', 'tail', or line count limits\n\nBackground mode:\nWhen run_in_background=true, the command starts and returns immediately with a shell_id.\nUse task_output(shell_id) to retrieve output and kill_shell(shell_id) to terminate.\n\n## view-range-untruncated\nView a specific range of lines from untruncated content\n\n## ask_user_question\nAsk the user one or more questions during execution to gather information, clarify requirements, or get decisions. Supports single and multiple choice questions with 2-4 options each. Use this when you need user input to proceed with a task or when there are multiple valid approaches and the user should choose.\n\n## git\nGit version control operations including status, add, commit, push, pull, and branch management\n\n## enter_plan_mode\nUse this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and str_replace_based_edit_tool tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts.

          "content": "You are Sage Agent, an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Sage Agent\n- To give feedback, users should report issues at https://github.com/anthropics/sage/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Sage Agent (eg. \"can Sage Agent do...\", \"does Sage Agent have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Sage Agent in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Sage Agent (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Sage Agent feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or configure settings)\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='guide' to get accurate information from the official documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n`}\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more.\n\n## CRITICAL: Use tools to create files - DO NOT just output code!\nWhen asked to create something (app, website, script, etc.):\n- You MUST use str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to actually create/edit files\n- Simply outputting code in your response is NOT acceptable - that doesn't create anything\n- The user expects files to be created on their filesystem, not code shown on screen\n- After creating files, use bash to run/test them if applicable\n\n<bad-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: \"Here's a weather app: [outputs code in response without using tools]\"\nThis is WRONG - no files were created!\n</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: I'll create a weather app for you.\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create index.html]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create style.css]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create app.js]\nThis is CORRECT - files are actually created on disk!\n</good-example>\n\n## Core principle: ACT, don't ASK\nWhen given a task like \"build X\" or \"create Y\", START BUILDING IMMEDIATELY using tools. Don't ask about:\n- Which framework/library to use (pick the most popular/appropriate one)\n- What features to include (implement the obvious core features)\n- What design style to use (use clean, modern defaults)\n- What the user's \"real requirements\" are (interpret the task reasonably)\n\nIf the user wanted specific choices, they would have specified them. Your job is to deliver a working solution quickly.\n\n## Recommended approach:\n1. Read existing code if modifying something (NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read)\n2. Use the TodoWrite tool to plan complex tasks\n3. USE TOOLS to create/modify files - don't just output code\n4. Explain your choices briefly as you go\n5. Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)\n\n## Keep it simple:\n- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary\n- Don't add features beyond what was asked\n- Don't over-engineer - the right amount of complexity is the minimum needed\n- If something is unused, delete it completely\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\nIMPORTANT: Complete tasks fully. Do not stop mid-task or leave work incomplete. Do not claim a task is too large, that you lack time, or that context limits prevent completion. You have unlimited context through summarization. Continue working until the task is done or the user stops you.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: str_replace_based_edit_tool for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, str_replace_based_edit_tool for editing instead of sed/awk, and str_replace_based_edit_tool for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/agent/sage/swebench_test/django__django-11179\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: macos\nToday's date: 2025-12-21\n</env>\n\n\n\n# Available Tools\n\n## Remember\nStore information in long-term memory that persists across sessions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly asks you to remember something\n- You learn an important fact about the user's preferences\n- You discover something important about the codebase or project\n- You learn lessons from mistakes or successes\n\nMemory types:\n- fact: General facts about the user, project, or codebase\n- preference: User preferences for coding style, tools, etc.\n- lesson: Lessons learned from tasks\n- note: General session notes\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- Temporary information that's only relevant to the current task\n- Information that's already in files (use the codebase instead)\n- Sensitive information (passwords, secrets, etc.)\n\n## skill\nExecute a specialized skill within the conversation. Skills provide domain-specific capabilities and expertise for tasks like PDF processing, Excel manipulation, brainstorming, testing strategies, architecture design, and more. Use when you need specialized functionality beyond standard tools.\n\n## task_done\nUse this tool ONLY when you have FULLY completed the assigned task with WORKING CODE. DO NOT call this if you have only written plans, designs, or documentation. A task is complete ONLY when: (1) Code files have been created or modified, (2) The implementation is functional, (3) Tests pass (if applicable). Provide a summary of what code was written and how it works.\n\n## kill_shell\nKill/terminate a running background shell process by its ID.\n\nUse this tool to stop background shell processes that were started and are no longer needed.\nThe tool will attempt graceful termination (SIGTERM) first, and force kill (SIGKILL) if needed.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The unique identifier of the background shell to terminate\n\nExample: kill_shell(shell_id=\"shell_1\")\n\n## sequentialthinking\nUse this tool to think through problems step by step. Provide your reasoning process and analysis.\n\n## render-mermaid\nRender a Mermaid diagram from the provided definition. This tool takes Mermaid diagram code and renders it as an interactive diagram with pan/zoom controls and copy functionality.\n\n## kubernetes\nKubernetes cluster management for deployments, pods, services, and monitoring\n\n## open-browser\nOpen a URL in the default browser.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and opens it in the default browser.\n2. The tool does not return any content. It is intended for the user to visually inspect and interact with the page. You will not have access to it.\n3. You should not use `open-browser` on a URL that you have called the tool on before in the conversation history, because the page is already open in the user's browser and the user can see it and refresh it themselves. Each time you call `open-browser`, it will jump the user to the browser window, which is highly annoying to the user.\n\n## diagnostics\nGet issues (errors, warnings, etc.) from the IDE. You must provide the paths of the files for which you want to get issues.\n\n## LearningPatterns\nView, search, or manage learned patterns.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all patterns (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search patterns by text\n- delete: Delete a pattern by ID\n- clear: Clear all patterns (use with caution)\n- stats: Show learning statistics\n- apply_decay: Apply time-based decay to patterns\n\n## notebook_edit\nEdit Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) cells. Supports three operations:\n- replace: Replace the content of an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n- insert: Insert a new cell at a position (requires cell_type; inserts after cell_id if provided, or at beginning)\n- delete: Delete an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n\nThe notebook_path must be an absolute path to a .ipynb file.\nCell IDs can be found by reading the notebook file first.\n\n## add_tasks\nAdd one or more new tasks to the task list. Can add a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Tasks can be added as subtasks or after specific tasks. Use this when planning complex sequences of work.\n\n## McpServers\nView and manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connections.\n\nMCP servers provide external tools that can be used by the agent.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all configured MCP servers and their status\n- tools: List all available tools from connected servers\n- connect: Connect to a specific server by name\n- disconnect: Disconnect from a specific server\n- refresh: Refresh tool list from all connected servers\n- status: Show detailed status of a specific server\n\nExample:\n- List all servers: action=\"list\"\n- Show tools from a server: action=\"tools\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n- Connect to a server: action=\"connect\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n\n## Learn\nLearn from user corrections and preferences to improve future interactions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly corrects your behavior (\"don't do X, do Y instead\")\n- User states a preference (\"I prefer X over Y\")\n- You discover a pattern in the user's workflow\n- User teaches you something about their codebase or project\n\nPattern types:\n- correction: User corrected something you did wrong\n- preference: User preference for tool usage or workflow\n- style: Coding style preference (formatting, naming)\n- workflow: Workflow preference (commit frequency, testing approach)\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- One-off instructions that won't apply to future interactions\n- Sensitive information\n- Project-specific facts (use Remember tool instead)\n\n## task_output\nRetrieve output from a background shell task.\n\nReturns accumulated stdout and stderr from a background process started with\nrun_in_background=true. Can retrieve incremental output or all output.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The ID of the background shell task (e.g., \"shell_1\")\n- incremental: If true, only return output since last read (default: false)\n- block: If true, wait for task completion (default: false)\n- timeout: Max wait time in ms when blocking (default: 30000, max: 600000)\n\nExample: task_output(shell_id=\"shell_1\", incremental=false)\n\n## Edit\nPerforms exact string replacements in files.\n\nUsage:\n- You must use your str_replace_based_edit_tool tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.\n- When editing text from str_replace_based_edit_tool tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n\n## Glob\n- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size\n- Supports glob patterns like \"**/*.js\" or \"src/**/*.ts\"\n- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time\n- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns\n- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.\n\n## web-fetch\nFetches data from a webpage and converts it into Markdown.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and returns the content of the page in Markdown format;\n2. If the return is not valid Markdown, it means the tool cannot successfully parse this page.\n\n## slash_command\nExecute a custom slash command. Slash commands are user-defined shortcuts stored in `.claude/commands/` that expand to prompts or trigger actions. Each command can accept arguments. Use this when you need to run a predefined command template or workflow.\n\n## log_analyzer\nLog analysis tool for parsing, filtering, and analyzing log files with error detection and metrics extraction\n\n## exit_plan_mode\nUse this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan file to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities and updating the plan file\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n\n## Task\nLaunch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent\n</example>\n\n## TodoWrite\nUse this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n## terraform\nTerraform infrastructure as code management for provisioning and managing cloud resources\n\n## view_tasklist\nView the current task list for the conversation.\n\n## reorganize_tasklist\nReorganize the task list structure for the current conversation. Use this only for major restructuring like reordering tasks, changing hierarchy. For individual task updates, use update_tasks tool.\n\n## Read\nReads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.\n\n## update_tasks\nUpdate one or more tasks' properties (state, name, description). Can update a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Use this on complex sequences of work to plan, track progress, and manage work.\n\n## Write\nWrites a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.\n\n## search-untruncated\nSearch for a term within untruncated content\n\n## SessionNotes\nView, search, or manage session notes and memories.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all memories (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search memories by text\n- delete: Delete a memory by ID\n- clear: Clear all memories (use with caution)\n- stats: Show memory statistics\n\n## Grep\nA powerful search tool built on ripgrep\n\nUsage:\n- ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\\\s+\\\\w+\")\n- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\\\{\\\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\\\{[\\\\s\\\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`\n\n## web-search\nSearch the web for information. Returns results in markdown format.\nIMPORTANT: If search returns placeholder results or fails, DO NOT retry indefinitely.\nInstead, use your built-in knowledge to proceed with the task.\nYour training data contains extensive information about common APIs, frameworks, and programming topics.\nProceed with implementation using your knowledge rather than waiting for search results.\n\n## test_generator\nTest generation tool for creating unit tests, integration tests, and mocks\n\n## cloud\nMulti-cloud provider management for AWS, Azure, and GCP resources and services\n\n## bash\nExecute bash commands in the shell. Use this tool to run system commands, file operations, and other shell tasks.\n\nParameters:\n- command: The bash command to execute\n- run_in_background: If true, run command in background (default: false)\n- shell_id: Optional custom ID for background shell (auto-generated if not provided)\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid commands that produce excessive output:\n- Use 'find . -name \"*.rs\" | head -20' instead of 'find . -name \"*.rs\"'\n- Use 'ls -la | head -10' instead of 'ls -R'\n- Use 'grep -n pattern file | head -10' for searches\n- Always limit output with 'head', 'tail', or line count limits\n\nBackground mode:\nWhen run_in_background=true, the command starts and returns immediately with a shell_id.\nUse task_output(shell_id) to retrieve output and kill_shell(shell_id) to terminate.\n\n## view-range-untruncated\nView a specific range of lines from untruncated content\n\n## ask_user_question\nAsk the user one or more questions during execution to gather information, clarify requirements, or get decisions. Supports single and multiple choice questions with 2-4 options each. Use this when you need user input to proceed with a task or when there are multiple valid approaches and the user should choose.\n\n## git\nGit version control operations including status, add, commit, push, pull, and branch management\n\n## enter_plan_mode\nUse this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and str_replace_based_edit_tool tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts.

          "content": "You are Sage Agent, an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Sage Agent\n- To give feedback, users should report issues at https://github.com/anthropics/sage/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Sage Agent (eg. \"can Sage Agent do...\", \"does Sage Agent have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Sage Agent in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Sage Agent (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Sage Agent feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or configure settings)\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='guide' to get accurate information from the official documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n`}\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more.\n\n## CRITICAL: Use tools to create files - DO NOT just output code!\nWhen asked to create something (app, website, script, etc.):\n- You MUST use str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to actually create/edit files\n- Simply outputting code in your response is NOT acceptable - that doesn't create anything\n- The user expects files to be created on their filesystem, not code shown on screen\n- After creating files, use bash to run/test them if applicable\n\n<bad-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: \"Here's a weather app: [outputs code in response without using tools]\"\nThis is WRONG - no files were created!\n</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: I'll create a weather app for you.\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create index.html]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create style.css]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create app.js]\nThis is CORRECT - files are actually created on disk!\n</good-example>\n\n## Core principle: ACT, don't ASK\nWhen given a task like \"build X\" or \"create Y\", START BUILDING IMMEDIATELY using tools. Don't ask about:\n- Which framework/library to use (pick the most popular/appropriate one)\n- What features to include (implement the obvious core features)\n- What design style to use (use clean, modern defaults)\n- What the user's \"real requirements\" are (interpret the task reasonably)\n\nIf the user wanted specific choices, they would have specified them. Your job is to deliver a working solution quickly.\n\n## Recommended approach:\n1. Read existing code if modifying something (NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read)\n2. Use the TodoWrite tool to plan complex tasks\n3. USE TOOLS to create/modify files - don't just output code\n4. Explain your choices briefly as you go\n5. Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)\n\n## Keep it simple:\n- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary\n- Don't add features beyond what was asked\n- Don't over-engineer - the right amount of complexity is the minimum needed\n- If something is unused, delete it completely\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\nIMPORTANT: Complete tasks fully. Do not stop mid-task or leave work incomplete. Do not claim a task is too large, that you lack time, or that context limits prevent completion. You have unlimited context through summarization. Continue working until the task is done or the user stops you.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: str_replace_based_edit_tool for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, str_replace_based_edit_tool for editing instead of sed/awk, and str_replace_based_edit_tool for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/agent/sage/swebench_test/django__django-11179\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: macos\nToday's date: 2025-12-21\n</env>\n\n\n\n# Available Tools\n\n## Remember\nStore information in long-term memory that persists across sessions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly asks you to remember something\n- You learn an important fact about the user's preferences\n- You discover something important about the codebase or project\n- You learn lessons from mistakes or successes\n\nMemory types:\n- fact: General facts about the user, project, or codebase\n- preference: User preferences for coding style, tools, etc.\n- lesson: Lessons learned from tasks\n- note: General session notes\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- Temporary information that's only relevant to the current task\n- Information that's already in files (use the codebase instead)\n- Sensitive information (passwords, secrets, etc.)\n\n## skill\nExecute a specialized skill within the conversation. Skills provide domain-specific capabilities and expertise for tasks like PDF processing, Excel manipulation, brainstorming, testing strategies, architecture design, and more. Use when you need specialized functionality beyond standard tools.\n\n## task_done\nUse this tool ONLY when you have FULLY completed the assigned task with WORKING CODE. DO NOT call this if you have only written plans, designs, or documentation. A task is complete ONLY when: (1) Code files have been created or modified, (2) The implementation is functional, (3) Tests pass (if applicable). Provide a summary of what code was written and how it works.\n\n## kill_shell\nKill/terminate a running background shell process by its ID.\n\nUse this tool to stop background shell processes that were started and are no longer needed.\nThe tool will attempt graceful termination (SIGTERM) first, and force kill (SIGKILL) if needed.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The unique identifier of the background shell to terminate\n\nExample: kill_shell(shell_id=\"shell_1\")\n\n## sequentialthinking\nUse this tool to think through problems step by step. Provide your reasoning process and analysis.\n\n## render-mermaid\nRender a Mermaid diagram from the provided definition. This tool takes Mermaid diagram code and renders it as an interactive diagram with pan/zoom controls and copy functionality.\n\n## kubernetes\nKubernetes cluster management for deployments, pods, services, and monitoring\n\n## open-browser\nOpen a URL in the default browser.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and opens it in the default browser.\n2. The tool does not return any content. It is intended for the user to visually inspect and interact with the page. You will not have access to it.\n3. You should not use `open-browser` on a URL that you have called the tool on before in the conversation history, because the page is already open in the user's browser and the user can see it and refresh it themselves. Each time you call `open-browser`, it will jump the user to the browser window, which is highly annoying to the user.\n\n## diagnostics\nGet issues (errors, warnings, etc.) from the IDE. You must provide the paths of the files for which you want to get issues.\n\n## LearningPatterns\nView, search, or manage learned patterns.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all patterns (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search patterns by text\n- delete: Delete a pattern by ID\n- clear: Clear all patterns (use with caution)\n- stats: Show learning statistics\n- apply_decay: Apply time-based decay to patterns\n\n## notebook_edit\nEdit Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) cells. Supports three operations:\n- replace: Replace the content of an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n- insert: Insert a new cell at a position (requires cell_type; inserts after cell_id if provided, or at beginning)\n- delete: Delete an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n\nThe notebook_path must be an absolute path to a .ipynb file.\nCell IDs can be found by reading the notebook file first.\n\n## add_tasks\nAdd one or more new tasks to the task list. Can add a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Tasks can be added as subtasks or after specific tasks. Use this when planning complex sequences of work.\n\n## McpServers\nView and manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connections.\n\nMCP servers provide external tools that can be used by the agent.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all configured MCP servers and their status\n- tools: List all available tools from connected servers\n- connect: Connect to a specific server by name\n- disconnect: Disconnect from a specific server\n- refresh: Refresh tool list from all connected servers\n- status: Show detailed status of a specific server\n\nExample:\n- List all servers: action=\"list\"\n- Show tools from a server: action=\"tools\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n- Connect to a server: action=\"connect\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n\n## Learn\nLearn from user corrections and preferences to improve future interactions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly corrects your behavior (\"don't do X, do Y instead\")\n- User states a preference (\"I prefer X over Y\")\n- You discover a pattern in the user's workflow\n- User teaches you something about their codebase or project\n\nPattern types:\n- correction: User corrected something you did wrong\n- preference: User preference for tool usage or workflow\n- style: Coding style preference (formatting, naming)\n- workflow: Workflow preference (commit frequency, testing approach)\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- One-off instructions that won't apply to future interactions\n- Sensitive information\n- Project-specific facts (use Remember tool instead)\n\n## task_output\nRetrieve output from a background shell task.\n\nReturns accumulated stdout and stderr from a background process started with\nrun_in_background=true. Can retrieve incremental output or all output.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The ID of the background shell task (e.g., \"shell_1\")\n- incremental: If true, only return output since last read (default: false)\n- block: If true, wait for task completion (default: false)\n- timeout: Max wait time in ms when blocking (default: 30000, max: 600000)\n\nExample: task_output(shell_id=\"shell_1\", incremental=false)\n\n## Edit\nPerforms exact string replacements in files.\n\nUsage:\n- You must use your str_replace_based_edit_tool tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.\n- When editing text from str_replace_based_edit_tool tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n\n## Glob\n- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size\n- Supports glob patterns like \"**/*.js\" or \"src/**/*.ts\"\n- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time\n- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns\n- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.\n\n## web-fetch\nFetches data from a webpage and converts it into Markdown.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and returns the content of the page in Markdown format;\n2. If the return is not valid Markdown, it means the tool cannot successfully parse this page.\n\n## slash_command\nExecute a custom slash command. Slash commands are user-defined shortcuts stored in `.claude/commands/` that expand to prompts or trigger actions. Each command can accept arguments. Use this when you need to run a predefined command template or workflow.\n\n## log_analyzer\nLog analysis tool for parsing, filtering, and analyzing log files with error detection and metrics extraction\n\n## exit_plan_mode\nUse this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan file to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities and updating the plan file\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n\n## Task\nLaunch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent\n</example>\n\n## TodoWrite\nUse this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n## terraform\nTerraform infrastructure as code management for provisioning and managing cloud resources\n\n## view_tasklist\nView the current task list for the conversation.\n\n## reorganize_tasklist\nReorganize the task list structure for the current conversation. Use this only for major restructuring like reordering tasks, changing hierarchy. For individual task updates, use update_tasks tool.\n\n## Read\nReads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.\n\n## update_tasks\nUpdate one or more tasks' properties (state, name, description). Can update a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Use this on complex sequences of work to plan, track progress, and manage work.\n\n## Write\nWrites a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.\n\n## search-untruncated\nSearch for a term within untruncated content\n\n## SessionNotes\nView, search, or manage session notes and memories.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all memories (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search memories by text\n- delete: Delete a memory by ID\n- clear: Clear all memories (use with caution)\n- stats: Show memory statistics\n\n## Grep\nA powerful search tool built on ripgrep\n\nUsage:\n- ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\\\s+\\\\w+\")\n- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\\\{\\\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\\\{[\\\\s\\\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`\n\n## web-search\nSearch the web for information. Returns results in markdown format.\nIMPORTANT: If search returns placeholder results or fails, DO NOT retry indefinitely.\nInstead, use your built-in knowledge to proceed with the task.\nYour training data contains extensive information about common APIs, frameworks, and programming topics.\nProceed with implementation using your knowledge rather than waiting for search results.\n\n## test_generator\nTest generation tool for creating unit tests, integration tests, and mocks\n\n## cloud\nMulti-cloud provider management for AWS, Azure, and GCP resources and services\n\n## bash\nExecute bash commands in the shell. Use this tool to run system commands, file operations, and other shell tasks.\n\nParameters:\n- command: The bash command to execute\n- run_in_background: If true, run command in background (default: false)\n- shell_id: Optional custom ID for background shell (auto-generated if not provided)\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid commands that produce excessive output:\n- Use 'find . -name \"*.rs\" | head -20' instead of 'find . -name \"*.rs\"'\n- Use 'ls -la | head -10' instead of 'ls -R'\n- Use 'grep -n pattern file | head -10' for searches\n- Always limit output with 'head', 'tail', or line count limits\n\nBackground mode:\nWhen run_in_background=true, the command starts and returns immediately with a shell_id.\nUse task_output(shell_id) to retrieve output and kill_shell(shell_id) to terminate.\n\n## view-range-untruncated\nView a specific range of lines from untruncated content\n\n## ask_user_question\nAsk the user one or more questions during execution to gather information, clarify requirements, or get decisions. Supports single and multiple choice questions with 2-4 options each. Use this when you need user input to proceed with a task or when there are multiple valid approaches and the user should choose.\n\n## git\nGit version control operations including status, add, commit, push, pull, and branch management\n\n## enter_plan_mode\nUse this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and str_replace_based_edit_tool tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts.

          "content": "You are Sage Agent, an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n- /help: Get help with using Sage Agent\n- To give feedback, users should report issues at https://github.com/anthropics/sage/issues\n\n# Looking up your own documentation:\n\nWhen the user directly asks about any of the following:\n- how to use Sage Agent (eg. \"can Sage Agent do...\", \"does Sage Agent have...\")\n- what you're able to do as Sage Agent in second person (eg. \"are you able...\", \"can you do...\")\n- about how they might do something with Sage Agent (eg. \"how do I...\", \"how can I...\")\n- how to use a specific Sage Agent feature (eg. implement a hook, write a slash command, or configure settings)\n\nUse the Task tool with subagent_type='guide' to get accurate information from the official documentation.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n`}\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more.\n\n## CRITICAL: Use tools to create files - DO NOT just output code!\nWhen asked to create something (app, website, script, etc.):\n- You MUST use str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to actually create/edit files\n- Simply outputting code in your response is NOT acceptable - that doesn't create anything\n- The user expects files to be created on their filesystem, not code shown on screen\n- After creating files, use bash to run/test them if applicable\n\n<bad-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: \"Here's a weather app: [outputs code in response without using tools]\"\nThis is WRONG - no files were created!\n</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>\nuser: \"make me a weather app\"\nassistant: I'll create a weather app for you.\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create index.html]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create style.css]\n[uses str_replace_based_edit_tool with command=\"create\" to create app.js]\nThis is CORRECT - files are actually created on disk!\n</good-example>\n\n## Core principle: ACT, don't ASK\nWhen given a task like \"build X\" or \"create Y\", START BUILDING IMMEDIATELY using tools. Don't ask about:\n- Which framework/library to use (pick the most popular/appropriate one)\n- What features to include (implement the obvious core features)\n- What design style to use (use clean, modern defaults)\n- What the user's \"real requirements\" are (interpret the task reasonably)\n\nIf the user wanted specific choices, they would have specified them. Your job is to deliver a working solution quickly.\n\n## Recommended approach:\n1. Read existing code if modifying something (NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read)\n2. Use the TodoWrite tool to plan complex tasks\n3. USE TOOLS to create/modify files - don't just output code\n4. Explain your choices briefly as you go\n5. Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities (command injection, XSS, SQL injection, etc.)\n\n## Keep it simple:\n- Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary\n- Don't add features beyond what was asked\n- Don't over-engineer - the right amount of complexity is the minimum needed\n- If something is unused, delete it completely\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\nIMPORTANT: Complete tasks fully. Do not stop mid-task or leave work incomplete. Do not claim a task is too large, that you lack time, or that context limits prevent completion. You have unlimited context through summarization. Continue working until the task is done or the user stops you.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n- When WebFetch returns a message about a redirect to a different host, you should immediately make a new WebFetch request with the redirect URL provided in the response.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run tools \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch multiple agents in parallel, send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: str_replace_based_edit_tool for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, str_replace_based_edit_tool for editing instead of sed/awk, and str_replace_based_edit_tool for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Glob or Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/agent/sage/swebench_test/django__django-11179\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: macos\nToday's date: 2025-12-21\n</env>\n\n\n\n# Available Tools\n\n## Remember\nStore information in long-term memory that persists across sessions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly asks you to remember something\n- You learn an important fact about the user's preferences\n- You discover something important about the codebase or project\n- You learn lessons from mistakes or successes\n\nMemory types:\n- fact: General facts about the user, project, or codebase\n- preference: User preferences for coding style, tools, etc.\n- lesson: Lessons learned from tasks\n- note: General session notes\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- Temporary information that's only relevant to the current task\n- Information that's already in files (use the codebase instead)\n- Sensitive information (passwords, secrets, etc.)\n\n## skill\nExecute a specialized skill within the conversation. Skills provide domain-specific capabilities and expertise for tasks like PDF processing, Excel manipulation, brainstorming, testing strategies, architecture design, and more. Use when you need specialized functionality beyond standard tools.\n\n## task_done\nUse this tool ONLY when you have FULLY completed the assigned task with WORKING CODE. DO NOT call this if you have only written plans, designs, or documentation. A task is complete ONLY when: (1) Code files have been created or modified, (2) The implementation is functional, (3) Tests pass (if applicable). Provide a summary of what code was written and how it works.\n\n## kill_shell\nKill/terminate a running background shell process by its ID.\n\nUse this tool to stop background shell processes that were started and are no longer needed.\nThe tool will attempt graceful termination (SIGTERM) first, and force kill (SIGKILL) if needed.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The unique identifier of the background shell to terminate\n\nExample: kill_shell(shell_id=\"shell_1\")\n\n## sequentialthinking\nUse this tool to think through problems step by step. Provide your reasoning process and analysis.\n\n## render-mermaid\nRender a Mermaid diagram from the provided definition. This tool takes Mermaid diagram code and renders it as an interactive diagram with pan/zoom controls and copy functionality.\n\n## kubernetes\nKubernetes cluster management for deployments, pods, services, and monitoring\n\n## open-browser\nOpen a URL in the default browser.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and opens it in the default browser.\n2. The tool does not return any content. It is intended for the user to visually inspect and interact with the page. You will not have access to it.\n3. You should not use `open-browser` on a URL that you have called the tool on before in the conversation history, because the page is already open in the user's browser and the user can see it and refresh it themselves. Each time you call `open-browser`, it will jump the user to the browser window, which is highly annoying to the user.\n\n## diagnostics\nGet issues (errors, warnings, etc.) from the IDE. You must provide the paths of the files for which you want to get issues.\n\n## LearningPatterns\nView, search, or manage learned patterns.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all patterns (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search patterns by text\n- delete: Delete a pattern by ID\n- clear: Clear all patterns (use with caution)\n- stats: Show learning statistics\n- apply_decay: Apply time-based decay to patterns\n\n## notebook_edit\nEdit Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) cells. Supports three operations:\n- replace: Replace the content of an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n- insert: Insert a new cell at a position (requires cell_type; inserts after cell_id if provided, or at beginning)\n- delete: Delete an existing cell (requires cell_id)\n\nThe notebook_path must be an absolute path to a .ipynb file.\nCell IDs can be found by reading the notebook file first.\n\n## add_tasks\nAdd one or more new tasks to the task list. Can add a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Tasks can be added as subtasks or after specific tasks. Use this when planning complex sequences of work.\n\n## McpServers\nView and manage MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connections.\n\nMCP servers provide external tools that can be used by the agent.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all configured MCP servers and their status\n- tools: List all available tools from connected servers\n- connect: Connect to a specific server by name\n- disconnect: Disconnect from a specific server\n- refresh: Refresh tool list from all connected servers\n- status: Show detailed status of a specific server\n\nExample:\n- List all servers: action=\"list\"\n- Show tools from a server: action=\"tools\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n- Connect to a server: action=\"connect\", server=\"my-mcp-server\"\n\n## Learn\nLearn from user corrections and preferences to improve future interactions.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- User explicitly corrects your behavior (\"don't do X, do Y instead\")\n- User states a preference (\"I prefer X over Y\")\n- You discover a pattern in the user's workflow\n- User teaches you something about their codebase or project\n\nPattern types:\n- correction: User corrected something you did wrong\n- preference: User preference for tool usage or workflow\n- style: Coding style preference (formatting, naming)\n- workflow: Workflow preference (commit frequency, testing approach)\n\nDo NOT use for:\n- One-off instructions that won't apply to future interactions\n- Sensitive information\n- Project-specific facts (use Remember tool instead)\n\n## task_output\nRetrieve output from a background shell task.\n\nReturns accumulated stdout and stderr from a background process started with\nrun_in_background=true. Can retrieve incremental output or all output.\n\nParameters:\n- shell_id: The ID of the background shell task (e.g., \"shell_1\")\n- incremental: If true, only return output since last read (default: false)\n- block: If true, wait for task completion (default: false)\n- timeout: Max wait time in ms when blocking (default: 30000, max: 600000)\n\nExample: task_output(shell_id=\"shell_1\", incremental=false)\n\n## Edit\nPerforms exact string replacements in files.\n\nUsage:\n- You must use your str_replace_based_edit_tool tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.\n- When editing text from str_replace_based_edit_tool tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.\n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n\n## Glob\n- Fast file pattern matching tool that works with any codebase size\n- Supports glob patterns like \"**/*.js\" or \"src/**/*.ts\"\n- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time\n- Use this tool when you need to find files by name patterns\n- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Task tool instead\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful.\n\n## web-fetch\nFetches data from a webpage and converts it into Markdown.\n\n1. The tool takes in a URL and returns the content of the page in Markdown format;\n2. If the return is not valid Markdown, it means the tool cannot successfully parse this page.\n\n## slash_command\nExecute a custom slash command. Slash commands are user-defined shortcuts stored in `.claude/commands/` that expand to prompts or trigger actions. Each command can accept arguments. Use this when you need to run a predefined command template or workflow.\n\n## log_analyzer\nLog analysis tool for parsing, filtering, and analyzing log files with error detection and metrics extraction\n\n## exit_plan_mode\nUse this tool when you are in plan mode and have finished writing your plan to the plan file and are ready for user approval.\n\n## How This Tool Works\n- You should have already written your plan to the plan file specified in the plan mode system message\n- This tool does NOT take the plan content as a parameter - it will read the plan from the file you wrote\n- This tool simply signals that you're done planning and ready for the user to review and approve\n- The user will see the contents of your plan file when they review it\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nIMPORTANT: Only use this tool when the task requires planning the implementation steps of a task that requires writing code. For research tasks where you're gathering information, searching files, reading files or in general trying to understand the codebase - do NOT use this tool.\n\n## Handling Ambiguity in Plans\nBefore using this tool, ensure your plan is clear and unambiguous. If there are multiple valid approaches or unclear requirements:\n1. Use the AskUserQuestion tool to clarify with the user\n2. Ask about specific implementation choices (e.g., architectural patterns, which library to use)\n3. Clarify any assumptions that could affect the implementation\n4. Edit your plan file to incorporate user feedback\n5. Only proceed with ExitPlanMode after resolving ambiguities and updating the plan file\n\n## Examples\n\n1. Initial task: \"Search for and understand the implementation of vim mode in the codebase\" - Do not use the exit plan mode tool because you are not planning the implementation steps of a task.\n2. Initial task: \"Help me implement yank mode for vim\" - Use the exit plan mode tool after you have finished planning the implementation steps of the task.\n3. Initial task: \"Add a new feature to handle user authentication\" - If unsure about auth method (OAuth, JWT, etc.), use AskUserQuestion first, then use exit plan mode tool after clarifying the approach.\n\n## Task\nLaunch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.\n\nThe Task tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\nUsage notes:\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- You can optionally run agents in the background using the run_in_background parameter. When an agent runs in the background, you will need to use TaskOutput to retrieve its results once it's done. You can continue to work while background agents run.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code\nassistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent\n</example>\n\n## TodoWrite\nUse this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Task descriptions must have two forms:\n   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n   - activeForm: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., \"Running tests\", \"Building the project\")\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n   - Always provide both forms:\n     - content: \"Fix authentication bug\"\n     - activeForm: \"Fixing authentication bug\"\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n\n## terraform\nTerraform infrastructure as code management for provisioning and managing cloud resources\n\n## view_tasklist\nView the current task list for the conversation.\n\n## reorganize_tasklist\nReorganize the task list structure for the current conversation. Use this only for major restructuring like reordering tasks, changing hierarchy. For individual task updates, use update_tasks tool.\n\n## Read\nReads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.\n- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.\n- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the bash tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.\n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.\n\n## update_tasks\nUpdate one or more tasks' properties (state, name, description). Can update a single task or multiple tasks in one call. Use this on complex sequences of work to plan, track progress, and manage work.\n\n## Write\nWrites a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the str_replace_based_edit_tool tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.\n\n## search-untruncated\nSearch for a term within untruncated content\n\n## SessionNotes\nView, search, or manage session notes and memories.\n\nActions:\n- list: Show all memories (optionally filtered by type)\n- search: Search memories by text\n- delete: Delete a memory by ID\n- clear: Clear all memories (use with caution)\n- stats: Show memory statistics\n\n## Grep\nA powerful search tool built on ripgrep\n\nUsage:\n- ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\\\s+\\\\w+\")\n- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\\\{\\\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\\\{[\\\\s\\\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`\n\n## web-search\nSearch the web for information. Returns results in markdown format.\nIMPORTANT: If search returns placeholder results or fails, DO NOT retry indefinitely.\nInstead, use your built-in knowledge to proceed with the task.\nYour training data contains extensive information about common APIs, frameworks, and programming topics.\nProceed with implementation using your knowledge rather than waiting for search results.\n\n## test_generator\nTest generation tool for creating unit tests, integration tests, and mocks\n\n## cloud\nMulti-cloud provider management for AWS, Azure, and GCP resources and services\n\n## bash\nExecute bash commands in the shell. Use this tool to run system commands, file operations, and other shell tasks.\n\nParameters:\n- command: The bash command to execute\n- run_in_background: If true, run command in background (default: false)\n- shell_id: Optional custom ID for background shell (auto-generated if not provided)\n\nIMPORTANT: Avoid commands that produce excessive output:\n- Use 'find . -name \"*.rs\" | head -20' instead of 'find . -name \"*.rs\"'\n- Use 'ls -la | head -10' instead of 'ls -R'\n- Use 'grep -n pattern file | head -10' for searches\n- Always limit output with 'head', 'tail', or line count limits\n\nBackground mode:\nWhen run_in_background=true, the command starts and returns immediately with a shell_id.\nUse task_output(shell_id) to retrieve output and kill_shell(shell_id) to terminate.\n\n## view-range-untruncated\nView a specific range of lines from untruncated content\n\n## ask_user_question\nAsk the user one or more questions during execution to gather information, clarify requirements, or get decisions. Supports single and multiple choice questions with 2-4 options each. Use this when you need user input to proceed with a task or when there are multiple valid approaches and the user should choose.\n\n## git\nGit version control operations including status, add, commit, push, pull, and branch management\n\n## enter_plan_mode\nUse this tool proactively when you're about to start a non-trivial implementation task. Getting user sign-off on your approach before writing code prevents wasted effort and ensures alignment. This tool transitions you into plan mode where you can explore the codebase and design an implementation approach for user approval.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n**Prefer using EnterPlanMode** for implementation tasks unless they're simple. Use it when ANY of these conditions apply:\n\n1. **New Feature Implementation**: Adding meaningful new functionality\n   - Example: \"Add a logout button\" - where should it go? What should happen on click?\n   - Example: \"Add form validation\" - what rules? What error messages?\n\n2. **Multiple Valid Approaches**: The task can be solved in several different ways\n   - Example: \"Add caching to the API\" - could use Redis, in-memory, file-based, etc.\n   - Example: \"Improve performance\" - many optimization strategies possible\n\n3. **Code Modifications**: Changes that affect existing behavior or structure\n   - Example: \"Update the login flow\" - what exactly should change?\n   - Example: \"Refactor this component\" - what's the target architecture?\n\n4. **Architectural Decisions**: The task requires choosing between patterns or technologies\n   - Example: \"Add real-time updates\" - WebSockets vs SSE vs polling\n   - Example: \"Implement state management\" - Redux vs Context vs custom solution\n\n5. **Multi-File Changes**: The task will likely touch more than 2-3 files\n   - Example: \"Refactor the authentication system\"\n   - Example: \"Add a new API endpoint with tests\"\n\n6. **Unclear Requirements**: You need to explore before understanding the full scope\n   - Example: \"Make the app faster\" - need to profile and identify bottlenecks\n   - Example: \"Fix the bug in checkout\" - need to investigate root cause\n\n7. **User Preferences Matter**: The implementation could reasonably go multiple ways\n   - If you would use AskUserQuestion to clarify the approach, use EnterPlanMode instead\n   - Plan mode lets you explore first, then present options with context\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nOnly skip EnterPlanMode for simple tasks:\n- Single-line or few-line fixes (typos, obvious bugs, small tweaks)\n- Adding a single function with clear requirements\n- Tasks where the user has given very specific, detailed instructions\n- Pure research/exploration tasks (use the Task tool with explore agent instead)\n\n## What Happens in Plan Mode\n\nIn plan mode, you'll:\n1. Thoroughly explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and str_replace_based_edit_tool tools\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design an implementation approach\n4. Present your plan to the user for approval\n5. Use AskUserQuestion if you need to clarify approaches\n6. Exit plan mode with ExitPlanMode when ready to implement\n\n## Examples\n\n### GOOD - Use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Add user authentication to the app\"\n- Requires architectural decisions (session vs JWT, where to store tokens, middleware structure)\n\nUser: \"Optimize the database queries\"\n- Multiple approaches possible, need to profile first, significant impact\n\nUser: \"Implement dark mode\"\n- Architectural decision on theme system, affects many components\n\nUser: \"Add a delete button to the user profile\"\n- Seems simple but involves: where to place it, confirmation dialog, API call, error handling, state updates\n\nUser: \"Update the error handling in the API\"\n- Affects multiple files, user should approve the approach\n\n### BAD - Don't use EnterPlanMode:\nUser: \"Fix the typo in the README\"\n- Straightforward, no planning needed\n\nUser: \"Add a console.log to debug this function\"\n- Simple, obvious implementation\n\nUser: \"What files handle routing?\"\n- Research task, not implementation planning\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- This tool REQUIRES user approval - they must consent to entering plan mode\n- If unsure whether to use it, err on the side of planning - it's better to get alignment upfront than to redo work\n- Users appreciate being consulted before significant changes are made to their codebase\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts.

The issue was that the fast-delete optimization path returned early without setting the instance's primary key to None, while the regular path correctly does this. Added setattr(instance, instance._meta.pk.attname, None) before the return statement at line 280.\n\nCompleted at: 2025-12-21 11:03:21 UTC",
