/// Read tool description - comprehensive file reading guidance
pub const READ: &str = r#"Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.
- This tool can read PDF files (.pdf). PDFs are processed page by page, extracting both text and visual content for analysis.
- This tool can read Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and returns all cells with their outputs, combining code, text, and visualizations.
- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the ${BASH_TOOL_NAME} tool.
- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.
- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot, ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents."#;

/// Edit tool description - string replacement guidance
pub const EDIT: &str = r#"Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must use your ${READ_TOOL_NAME} tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from ${READ_TOOL_NAME} tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab. Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.
- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`.
- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance."#;

/// Write tool description - file creation guidance
pub const WRITE: &str = r#"Writes a file to the local filesystem.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the ${READ_TOOL_NAME} tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked."#;
