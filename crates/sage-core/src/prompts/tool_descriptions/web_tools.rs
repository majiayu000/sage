/// WebFetch tool description
pub const WEB_FETCH: &str = r#"- Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it using an AI model
- Takes a URL and a prompt as input
- Fetches the URL content, converts HTML to markdown
- Processes the content with the prompt using a small, fast model
- Returns the model's response about the content
- Use this tool when you need to retrieve and analyze web content

Usage notes:
  - IMPORTANT: If an MCP-provided web fetch tool is available, prefer using that tool instead of this one, as it may have fewer restrictions.
  - The URL must be a fully-formed valid URL
  - HTTP URLs will be automatically upgraded to HTTPS
  - The prompt should describe what information you want to extract from the page
  - This tool is read-only and does not modify any files
  - Results may be summarized if the content is very large
  - Includes a self-cleaning 15-minute cache for faster responses when repeatedly accessing the same URL
  - When a URL redirects to a different host, the tool will inform you and provide the redirect URL in a special format. You should then make a new ${WEB_FETCH_TOOL_NAME} request with the redirect URL to fetch the content."#;

/// WebSearch tool description
pub const WEB_SEARCH: &str = r#"- Allows you to search the web and use the results to inform responses
- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data
- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks, including links as markdown hyperlinks
- Use this tool for accessing information beyond knowledge cutoff
- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - You MUST follow this:
  - After answering the user's question, you MUST include a "Sources:" section at the end of your response
  - In the Sources section, list all relevant URLs from the search results as markdown hyperlinks: [Title](URL)
  - This is MANDATORY - never skip including sources in your response
  - Example format:

    [Your answer here]

    Sources:
    - [Source Title 1](https://example.com/1)
    - [Source Title 2](https://example.com/2)

Usage notes:
  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites

IMPORTANT - Use the correct year in search queries:
  - Today's date is ${CURRENT_DATE}. You MUST use this year when searching for recent information, documentation, or current events.
  - Example: If today is 2025-07-15 and the user asks for "latest React docs", search for "React documentation 2025", NOT "React documentation 2024""#;
