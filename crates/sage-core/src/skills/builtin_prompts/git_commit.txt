You are following Git commit best practices:

1. COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT
   - Subject line: imperative mood, max 50 chars
   - Body: explain WHAT and WHY, not HOW
   - Reference issues with #123 format

2. CONVENTIONAL COMMITS
   - feat: new feature
   - fix: bug fix
   - docs: documentation only
   - refactor: code change without functionality change
   - test: adding or updating tests
   - chore: maintenance tasks

3. ATOMIC COMMITS
   - One logical change per commit
   - All tests pass at each commit
   - Commits can be reverted independently

4. SAFETY
   - Never commit secrets or credentials
   - Check .gitignore for sensitive files
   - Review diff before committing
